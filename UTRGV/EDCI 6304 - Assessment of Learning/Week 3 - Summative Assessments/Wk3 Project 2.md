# Introduction and Purpose

**_*Please note that this project is the second of five that will be combined in your final project during Week 7.   These will be artifacts to upload in your M.Ed digital portfolio._**

We begin officially planning our assessments as we move into stage 2 of the process. You should remember that because all of these assessments are embedded in instruction, that they also change or adjust according to what happened in the previous stage. Therefore, what you did in your balanced assessment plan to begin the process of objective-setting can still change in this stage.

Therefore, let's continue building the story by first figuring what we hope to see at the end.

In this lesson, I will break down the components of your second major project: Authentic Summative Assessment Plan. As you review the instructions and parameters, it is very important that you remember to follow them clearly. My style of reviewing projects is very detail-oriented and strict on the guidelines for quality.

If the rubric or the instructions are confusing, please make use of two very important avenues of assistance: Community Questions Forum and Virtual Office Hours.

## Planning the End: Your Purpose in this Project

Assessments build stories. In this second assessment project, you will plan the end. Like any good story, you hope to see some resolution at the end, and your summative assessment is planning for success and achievement.

The purpose of the authentic summative assessment is to design an authentic, real world PBL summative assessment for a unit or long lesson that will fit and be implemented into your current or future classroom situation. In your readings from this week, you learned that there are three types of PBLs:   performance, project, and problem based, so you will select one.   They have some overlapping elements, but the essential piece is that it is **_not_** a traditional paper and pencil test, nor a worksheet with word problems. It is intended to assess an objective with several potential skills that apply to the real world outside the classroom.

You already got started in the Balanced Assessment Plan by determining objectives for the three purposes for assessment.   You will be using and revising the one you submitted for your assessment **_of_** learning, which is the summative objective.   This one measures achievement at the end of a unit or lesson.

# What You Will Plan for the Summative Assessment

Planning a project, a problem-based scenario, or a performance-based project means putting together a description for the students, a list of materials and resources they will use, any templates, and additional instructions, and the rubric that will be used to grade them.

Therefore, what you will turn in is exactly what you would have ready for your students in order to get started. Expect that you will have more than just a description, just like you would have more than just a description for the students.

Here is what you should expect to develop based on a realistic view of your past or future teaching. This could be a repurposed lesson from last year, to convert it to a PBL, or a new one for a unit or objective that has historically shown poor performance by your students. Whatever you decide to plan, you should build it to implement it.

Here is the list of all you will be submitting for this project:

1. The description handout for the students that describes the project, problem-based scenario, or performance-based project.
2. Public links or attached documents to the materials students will use to complete the project.
3. The full rubric you will use to grade the project, problem-based scenario, or performance-based project.
4. A reflection

What follows is a breakdown of each of these deliverables.
# First, Revisit Your Objective from the Balanced Assessment Plan [[Project Objectives]]

Before you decide to take the learning objective for assessment of learning that you submitted for your balanced assessment plan, you need to first determine if revisions are needed.

![flow chart for revising objective](https://www.softchalkcloud.com/lesson/files/wAuyFGsdzkD95l/Decision%20Flowchart%20to%20Revise%20Your%20Learning%20Objective%20for%20As.jpg)

You may also open the text-based version of the above flowchart: [Decision Flowchart to Revise Your Learning Objective for Assessment of Learning](https://www.softchalkcloud.com/lesson/files/wAuyFGsdzkD95l/Decision%20Flowchart%20to%20Revise%20Your%20Learning%20Objective%20for%20As.pdf "Decision Flowchart to Revise Your Learning Objective for Assessment of Learning")

If you answered "yes" to all of the above, then you are ready to make sure it is aligned with proper rigor to your standards.

## Aligned Objectives with Proper Rigor

All assessments have an accompanying objective that determines the content, thinking level, and degree of mastery that is necessary in achieving success.   You reviewed information on alignment and rigor, so that the Balanced Assessment objective you submitted may need to be adjusted to ensure this occurs.  

You should have selected a standard or standards already, so that now, you are going to make sure they align to your objective with the proper rigor. Below are the linked presentations to help you review your objective for proper alignment and rigor.

|   |   |
|---|---|
How to Align with Rigor to a Standard
|Alignment|Rigor|
|[Alignment PowerPoint](https://www.softchalkcloud.com/lesson/files/wAuyFGsdzkD95l/Alignment%20PPT.pdf "Alignment PowerPoint")|[Rigor PowerPoint](https://www.softchalkcloud.com/lesson/files/wAuyFGsdzkD95l/Rigor%20PPT.pdf "Rigor PowerPoint")|

Keep in mind that even if your objective passed all three criteria above, if it doesn't align with the proper rigor of your standard, you may need to revise it. However, DO NOT change the project, problem-based scenario, or performance-based assessment.

If you find that your selected standard cannot align or does not have the same rigor as your objective or vice versa, then you have two options:

1. Select a new standard.
2. OR rewrite a new objective to fit the standard you selected.

In either of the above scenarios, you will likely need to adjust or completely change your two formative assessment objectives. Remember that the formative assessments scaffold and guide students toward gaining the skills they will need for the summative assessment.

Whatever revisions you may need, you will need to remember that PBLs lend themselves to the top three levels in Bloom's cognitive taxonomy and do not align very well with lower level thinking standards.   Therefore, select with care and do not chose any standards with basic level verbs like "understand" or "remember" or any synonym variations of those.

# Second, Create the Project, Problem-Based Scenario, or Performance-Based Project

Now that your objective has been refined and updated to proper alignment and rigor, as well as revise for any missing components from the first stage, you will now build your project description for your students.

Regardless of which of the three types of PBL's you decide to use for your summative assessment, they always have several characteristics in common:

- ==connected to the real world outside the classroom==
- ==meaningful to the student, so that it motivates them to engage in it==
- ==require higher order thinking through creativity or problem-solving==

Each of the three PBL's do it in a slightly different manner, but they all require that students be able to do the above.

Your PBL assessment should ask students to do something meaningful that allows them to make connections to their immediate community or the world in general.   We live in a highly connected world, and possibilities for making students engage in something that makes them aware of their role in society—to advocate, to make change, or to help—has expanded due to uses of connected technologies.

Consider what you are asking students to do to demonstrate achievement in the learning objective.  

- Does it allow them to become aware of a need in society?  
- Do they create something that is usable in the real world?  
- Do they do something in their community that advocates or meets a need?

Keep in mind that this is not volunteerism, but much more meaningful engagement.

## Project-Based

Project based learning can use both analog (paper, craft materials, etc.) and technology-based tools. However, the skill of coloring, formatting, and design should not be the measure of quality unless you teach a course on design that specifically targets these.

Examples of projects with real world connections include the following:

- infographics
- brochures
- flyers
- newsletters
- resumes

This is just a general list, but feel free to share other examples of real world projects in the Community Questions Forum. For English or language arts teachers, please note that while writing is a big part of our curriculum, it does not have to lead to an essay, paragraph, or report, that is disconnected from real life. Even literature deconstructions for AP can be connected to real life in some way. After all, characters in stories are all based on humanity and real people. Give them some life in a project that requires more than just writing skill.

## Problem-Based Scenarios

Problem-based learning can also use both analog and technology-based tools. However, word problems that use real world scenarios in a worksheet are nt problem-based because the just use disconnected explanations in order toward the same end as if you'd just given them numerical equations to solve: they still end up with a set mathematical solution, such as one right answer or number.

Real problem based learning is about solving larger problems from real life. Here are some examples:

- Using science skills to solve the problem of poor potable water conditions for members of poor communities like colonias or other rural, unincorporated communities. This would mean finding a real community either locally, state, national, or international to solve the problem.
- Using math skills to figure out how to build a ramp that makes a real building in the community wheelchair accessible. This would mean finding an actual public place that is not wheelchair accessible.

This is why the subheading describes them as **"problem-based scenarios"**. You must bring the real life scenario to stage the problem. Without one broad scenario, you do not have problem-based learning. If you have multiple, disconnected scenarios, you also don't have problem-based learning.

## Performance-Based Projects

Performance-based projects demonstrates a behavior that can't be written down. It must be done to show it. The most common performance-based projects are those where the student demonstrates an ability, such as how to dance a particular style, how to exercise safely, how to cook a recipe. Performance-based is all about how to do something, but it is also connected to the real world. Yes, even the arts can connect to the real world.

Most teachers mistakenly assume that asking students to make an oral report or presentation is performance-based. It is not. Creating a PowerPoint for the purpose of describing the plot elements in a novel is not real world authentic. However, if you ask students to create a presentation in any given slide or presentation tool to tell younger children a story in a Boys and Girls Club or other community event, that makes it real world authentic. The authenticity comes from **_presenting outside your classroom walls to a group of people in the community._**

Here are some examples for presentations that can be meaningful and real world authentic:

- Using science skills to find out what harmful species of insects live in a local park in order to bring awareness to the community about the dangers of going into the water, or overgrown areas. The presentation is to them, not the teacher and students in the classroom.
- Using math skills to determine cost and budget for a fundraising event that will help fund a fieldtrip to a local museum and presenting this to the school board or principal to gain permission.

These examples are intended to give you ideas on how to use your own creativity and real-world relevance in your own classroom.   Please do not use any variations of these when you plan your assessment.   Be original.

Using Generative AI to Help you Plan a PBL

You may use Microsoft Copilot to help you plan your PBL, as long as the final submission is your own final work, as per the syllabus guidelines (80% or more). If you use AI, be transparent and include your conversation transcript with your prompts in an appendix at the end of the document where you create your description.

Keep in mind that prompting and conversation are the key to a more relevant and potentially beneficial experience. The more details you provide, the better it gets at assisting. Just remember that AI should never do your work for you.

## Third, Rubric Evaluation Tool

During this week's readings, you got a much closer look at how to design rubrics—as well as how not to design them—by focusing on three types:   general rubrics, task-specific rubrics, and proficiency-based rubrics.   They can be either analytic or holistic, as indicated in the table below.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
Table of Rubric Types
||Holistic|Analytic|
|Task-Specific||*|
|General|*|*|
|Proficiency-Based|*|*|

The best rubric to use for a summative PBL is the task-specific rubric, although proficiency rubrics can work as well. General rubrics should not evaluate a PBL, so don't use this type.

See the examples of a holistic and analytic rubric.

You may also use the direct link to the website to view the above: [Types of Rubrics Holistic and Analytic](https://www.southwestern.edu/offices/writing/faculty-resources-for-writing-instruction/designing-rubrics/deciding-which-type-of-rubric-to-use/ "Types of Rubrics Holistic and Analytic")

In these examples, the holistic rubric is a general, holistic rubric, and the analytic is a task-specific, analytic rubric. The examples are provides so that you can see how the formatting is different for each. It does not mean that these rubrics meet all the criteria for a good rubric. For that, please cross-reference your readings from your textbook.

You will design one rubric to evaluate the PBL your students create.   Although the textbook makes the case for all of these being formative, all of these rubrics lend themselves to summative grading.   I tend to use variations of the analytic general and task-specific rubrics for your assessment projects.   It is okay to merge some elements, but be careful that you still have a rubric that does the following:

1. Evaluates the student's achievement in the learning objective, not how many parts it had.
2. Uses criteria that describe vital elements of the work, which contribute the demonstrated learning of the objective.   There is no rule of thumb for number of criteria to include in a rubric.   However, too many makes the use of it too belabored, and too few of them don't address the depth and complexity of a PBL.   My experience has shown me that 4 or 5 are magic numbers, with 3 an option for PBLs in lower grade levels (K-2).
3. Uses quality descriptors that describe quality not quantity, in at least three levels of proficiency.   Use only descriptive levels of proficiency, not numerical or point values.

**_A note on using grammar and usage as a criterion:_**   as teachers, we all want our students to put their best foot forward and use proper conventions in any written aspects of their work.   However, it isn't always relevant to the learning objective, unless you merge it in a meaningful criterion.   Here's an example of a do and don't:

- **DON'T:**   Grammar and Usage:   students use proper grammar, spelling, etc. in their projects
- **DO:**   Content Terminology:   students presented ideas in proper language, using the language of math (or science) appropriately in their projects.

There are many ways that you can embed grammar and good writing into a criterion that connects to the objective.   This is one very generic example to help you understand the difference between isolating grammar as a criterion (a don't, unless you teach English), and embedding it as a way to demonstrate learning of the objective.

# How do I Put All This Together?

This assessment project has two audiences, so make sure you use the appropriate structure and descriptions for each.

## Description Handout for the Students

Your first audience is your students (not real students at this time as as you likely are not teaching at the moment, but imagined students). The description of the assignment with all its process and components is for your students, so make it grade appropriate for them. You can write this up in Word document.

If students require tools, templates, materials, etc., to complete the PBL, then you also include those as separate attachments, or embed them in the description. Make sure that whatever extras you are including that you match the name of the file to the name you use in the description. If you indicate that students will use a checklist of requirements, then you will need to include the file with the actual checklist, and name it the same way.

**_*Please note that if your students will be using digital tools to engage in this PBL, you will also need to include a shared link--or if it is password protected behind a teacher tool--a screen grab of where it is, in addition to the Word document._**

## The Rubric

Since you will grade your students with this rubric, it is advisable that you write it in the way students can understand. You can also create this tool in a Word document, using the Insert Table feature. You can include it in the same document as the student handout or you can save it as a separate file. The submission area will allow you to attach multiple files in one submission.

**_*Please note that if your students will be using digital tools to engage in this PBL, and this tool contains a way to add a rubric--like Google Classroom--you will also need to include a shared link--or if it is password protected behind a teacher tool--a screen grab of where it is, in addition to the Word document. Creating the rubric in a digital platform will save you a lot of time in data analysis later.

# Reflection

After completing the assessment description and rubric, you will write a reflection on your learning process as a teacher.   All good teachers improve by first self-examining their practice and how it fits with your personal philosophy of learning and teaching.   In this reflection, you will talk about your experience designing an authentic summative assessment.   How was it different from the assessments you usually use?   How did it challenge your preconceptions of what an assessment should be?   How difficult was it for you to create a PBL suitable to your grade level and content area and why?

Write at least two well-developed paragraphs with a thorough reflection.   Double spacing is appreciated, since it makes it easier to read.   Thoroughness of reflection is evaluated, but not length.   However, too short a reflection leaves your thoughts undeveloped, and too long a reflection overdoes it.

Please note that there are some guidelines of this reflection that are similar to the one you wrote for your balanced assessment plan.   These are repeated, but within the context of this project, so consider your experience building this authentic summative assessment.

This can be composed in a separate Word file and attached together with the others.

# The Feedback You Will Receive

All project submissions will receive a grade. The grade is determined by the level of quality you demonstrate in the grading rubric. I recommend you review the rubric carefully so that you understand what the expectation of quality will be. Below is a link to the grading rubric, which you can also view in the assignment submission area.

[Authentic Summative Assessment Grading Rubric](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uMYclmCTvsFhEF4tGz8zzqRtz5y24vGZ/view?usp=sharing "Authentic Summative Assessment Grading Rubric")

When you first receive your grade, you should open the rubric to determine how the points were awarded to you. This will help you identify the areas of your project that will benefit from improvement.

You will  have an opportunity to submit a revised version of your project in the same submission area where you originally submitted. _It is important that a revision be submitted before the next major project because all the projects are connected, and what you do in one, affects what you do in another._

Therefore, always wait for your revisions to be reviewed by me before you dive into the next project. Remember that early birds get feedback and grades faster.
