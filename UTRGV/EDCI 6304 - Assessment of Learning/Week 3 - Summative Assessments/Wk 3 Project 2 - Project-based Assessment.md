### Project Title: Designing a Rainwater Harvesting System

### Overview

As climate change leads to more frequent and intense storms, communities face challenges in managing the increased volume of rainwater. In this project, you will design a rainwater harvesting system that effectively captures and stores rainwater from storm events. Your goal is to ensure that valuable water resources are not lost and can be utilized for personal or agricultural needs.

### Objectives

- Research rainfall data from a selected storm.
- Calculate the volume of water that can be harvested based on your chosen catchment area and surface material.
- Design a non-scaled model of a rainwater harvesting system.

### Steps to Complete the Project

1. **Select a Storm**:
    - You will be given a list of recent storms. Choose one storm to research its rainfall data. Record the total rainfall amount.
2. **Choose a Catchment Area**:
    - Decide on the type of catchment area you will use for your design. You can choose from:
        - Triangular
        - Rectangular
        - Circular
    - Use the provided worksheet to find the appropriate formula for calculating the area based on your choice.
3. **Determine the Surface Material**:
    - Select a surface material for your catchment area. Refer to the runoff coefficient table on the worksheet to understand how different materials affect water collection.
4. **Calculate Potential Water Harvested**:
    - Use the formula:  
	    `V = A x R x C`
        Where:
        -  = volume of water harvested (in gallons)
        -  = catchment area (in square feet)
        -  = total rainfall from the storm (in feet)
        -  = runoff coefficient (based on your selected surface material)
5. **Water Storage Capacity**:
    - Refer to the "Water Storage Capacity Needed for a Household Committing to Use Harvested Rainwater as the Primary Water Source" section on the worksheet to determine how much storage capacity you will need for your system.
6. **Design a Non-Scaled Model**:
    - Create a non-scaled model of your rainwater harvesting system. This can be done using materials like cardboard, paper, or any other craft supplies. Your model should include:
        - The catchment area
        - The storage tank
        - Any additional components (e.g., filtration system, overflow system)
7. **Documentation**:
    - Prepare a brief report that includes:
        - The storm you researched and its rainfall data.
        - Your calculations for the volume of water collected.
        - A description of your design choices and the components of your model.

### Materials Needed

- Access to research tools (internet, library)
- Worksheet with formulas and runoff coefficients
- [[Rainwater Harvest Calculations.pdf]] - https://www.harvestingrainwater.com/wp-content/uploads/Appendix3Calculations.pdf 
- Craft materials for the model (cardboard, paper, scissors, glue, etc.)
