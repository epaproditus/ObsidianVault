###### How was it different from the assessments you usually use?  
This assessment is entirely different to the way I usually assess students with traditional assessment. This assessment takes into account a real-world problem (lack of water) and utilizes the mathematics learn to actually attempt to analyze the problem and solve it (even it at a micro scale). 

###### How did it challenge your preconceptions of what an assessment should be?   
This definitely challenged the way that I consider assessing and it reminded me of the problems I would see when studying Engineering myself whilst in college. In college, the engineering problems were very much based scenarios based where the assessments I experienced in class were very much paperwork and math-related. 


###### How difficult was it for you to create a PBL suitable to your grade level and content area and why?
This was *very* difficult. I struggled trying to figure out what would be a relevant problem to solve for my students, then I struggled on the scope of the assessment, then I struggled in the implementation of it. So much that this reflection is submitted almost a week later. *However*, I do find myself excited about it and how my students would apply the mathematics they learned in a more engaging way.
