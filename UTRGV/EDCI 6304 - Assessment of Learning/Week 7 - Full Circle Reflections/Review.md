The purpose of this review is to bring together the entire classroom assessment cycle to a closing for your final project. During these activities, you will be revisiting all the assessments and data you gathered to conclude what it all means for classroom instruction.

## Objective of this Review

Given readings on summative assessment data analysis, the in-service educator will identify essential applications of data in the Wk 6 Interactive Review Activities.

## How This Review Works

Therefore, by the end of this review, you will have both read through all your assigned materials this week, as well as interact with questions, both closed and open-ended, related to those readings.Â  Each embedded interactive activity indicates how many points it is worth.

This interactive review is worth a total of 30 points.

## Stage 6: Make Instructional Decisions

The first topic this week is to review stage six of the classroom assessment cycle: making instructional decisions. This is the final stage in the cycle, but it is, in some ways, the first stage in the next cycle of assessment. In your classroom, you will find that this cycle never stops.

Review the image below for additional information on how students can show various degrees of mastery of a learning objective.

### Using Achievement to Build ###
What do I need to include in a future lesson that will build on what students already achieved?

Your curriculum runs on a sequence, but that sequence can be adjusted based on the needs of the students, so that teachers need to be responsive to it. Achievement in an objective or unit means students are ready for higher cognitive challenge.

### Metacognitive Growth
What strategies do you need to include in a future lesson to build students' continued development toward metacognition?

Metacognition can be taught, and formative assessments in the use of strategies as part of learning is a way to find out what students are still missing in terms of thinking processes that can be taught later. In some cases, you may only get these opportunities in pull out or after school programs.

### Next Learning Objective
How can these data determine the next learning objective to restart the assessment cycle?

Although your curriculum is already set for the entire year by the school district, there are some ways in which you can adjust the objectives to make sure students can handle the next stage of learning. Objectives don't just determine content, but they also determine cognitive level. You can make adjustments to make sure your students can be successful. If cognitive or content level need to be adjusted for a student who struggled, you may need to create those opportunities in short term objectives in pull out or after school tutoring.

# Second Topic

## Being a Reflective Practitioner

Many times, the assessment cycle helps us determine not just what we can adjust in our current teaching, but also what we can adjust in our own practice for the next academic year or term, depending on how your school is structured.

When you implement the full assessment cycle, you don't just learn about your students' progress: you also learn about your own practice and what worked and didn't work. So in these cases, you consider how you adjust your own teaching for the next group of students. This is called being a reflective practitioner to improve your own practice. I have never taught this course or any other course the same way twice because every year, I learn something new about my students that I apply to my own reflective process.

Consider what you do every year or every new term when you start teaching a new group of students. Do you implement new methods or strategies you learn from professional development? Do you reflect yourself and make assessments or class activities different after finding out students struggle with them or find them too easy in the previous year?

What do you do to be a reflective practitioner every year?

Read the brief blog below for some practical advice on being a reflective teacher, the benefits, and strategies you can employ to grow in your self-directed learning, as well as a professional.

# Third Topic

## The Classroom Assessment Cycle Revisited

In this topic, we revisit the full classroom assessment cycle for the purpose of using it to complete your own classroom implementation of all your assessments. This summative is a way to start you thinking about your final project, where you will document all your steps, as they are outlined below. Review the cycle below first.![Classroom Assessment Cycle](https://www.softchalkcloud.com/lesson/files/PwITGLzXUsW1OH/Classroom%20Assessment%20Cycle%20Overview%20-%20For%20Download.png)

# Concluding Thoughts

## Summing Up Learning

This marks the complete cycle of the stages of classroom assessment. What remains is revision and reflection, which you have already begun to do. The experience of undergoing the entire assessment cycle in a very short time was difficult, but I hope rewarding in what you learned about your students. The expecation is that you will learn to adjust it to suit your students and your schedule, so that you create meaningful opportunities for your students.

## Final Steps

The only task left to do is to submit your Wk 7 Final Classroom Assessment Cycle & Portfolio Reflection. This final product will be uploaded to your M.Ed e-portfolio for review. Return to the course module for final instructions on how to go about this final submission.
