Chapter 2 outlines the importance of recognizing the distinct yet interrelated purposes of classroom assessment, emphasizing that understanding these purposes is crucial for effective implementation. The three primary purposes discussed are:

1. **Assessment for Learning**: This purpose focuses on using assessment to inform and modify teaching practices to enhance student learning. It highlights the significance of understanding each student’s unique learning needs and addressing them through differentiated instruction. Teachers gather information on students’ existing knowledge, misunderstandings, and learning pathways, which helps in streamlining instruction and providing timely feedback.

2. **Assessment as Learning**: This aspect emphasizes the students' role in their own learning processes. It encourages metacognition, where students actively monitor and evaluate their understanding, reflect on their learning strategies, and use this self-assessment to make adjustments. Educators are tasked with fostering an environment that promotes self-regulation and independence among learners.

3. **Assessment of Learning**: This purpose pertains to the evaluation of student proficiency against defined curriculum outcomes, typically at the end of a learning period. It serves to certify learning achievements and inform stakeholders, such as parents and future educators, about student performance. The assessment methods must be reliable, valid, and conducive to fairly representing students' knowledge and skills.

	

The chapter stresses the importance of balancing these purposes, with a recommendation that formative assessments (for learning and as learning) be prioritized over summative assessments (of learning) to foster a more supportive learning environment. Effective assessment practices are rooted in careful planning, ongoing feedback, and ensuring that they align with learning objectives.

To successfully implement these assessment purposes, educators need to engage in reflective practices and collaborative discussions that both verify the effectiveness of their assessment methods and support continuous improvement in teaching and learning outcomes.


###### Assessment of Learning 
occurs last in a lesson cycle because it is summative.  However, it is planned _**first**_.

**What thinking level will demonstrate proficiency?**

Because this is a summative knowledge or ability, your verb tends to be high in Bloom's taxonomy. It has to include critical thinking, and this only occurs high in Bloom's taxonomy:  analyze, evaluate, create.

**What do you want your students to know?**

Because it happens at the end of the lesson, the topic you identify has to be broad and cover more than one related skills or concepts.

**What will students do to demonstrate they can think about and use what they will know?**

Because this happens at the end, you have to think about a big task, assignment, or deliverable that will assess small and big skills found in the broad topic or unit. We will look at this more in depth in stage 2, but to plan the objective, name an authentic task, not a traditional one.  This means no tests, worksheets of unrelated mathematical problems to solve, or any other type of worksheet that disconnects each item from its larger purpose, such as drill related worksheets.

###### Assessment as Learning 
occurs in the middle of a lesson cycle because it is formative. This is planned _**second**_.

**What thinking level will demonstrate proficiency?**

Because this is formative, it supports student thinking so that they can be ready for the summative task.  This formative task is also high in Bloom's taxonomy because it is supposed to help students develop thinking processes that support the final learning.  Therefore, the types of verbs you may use for assessment as learning come from the analyze and evaluate portions of Bloom's taxonomy.

**What do you want your students to know?**

For this assessment, what students need to learn is how to think for themselves or how to make their thinking visible. This is a metacognitive learning objective because students show knowledge of thinking processes, problem solving patterns, habits of mind (pg. 23) or soft skills. These are selected based on the pre-requisit processes that your discipline requires.

**What will students do to demonstrate they can think about and use what they will know?**

This formative assessment is for self-assessment and reflection to determine if students know how to know, if they can identify the thinking processes their brain takes to reach learning. As an expert in your discipline, you would be the best person to understand what those pre-requisite skills are, and how your students can keep track of their thinking. These tasks tend to be smaller, can come as exit tickets or ongoing learning interactive journals. They tend to be ongoing, as students develop more complexity in their learning.

###### Assessment for Learning 
occurs first in a lesson cycle because it is formative.  However, it is planned _**last.**_

**What thinking level will demonstrate proficiency?**

In this formative task, your verb tends to be lower in Bloom's taxonomy because this assessment occurs before all the big learning has happened. It may include simple prior knowledge or diagnosis of gaps in previous related topics. The verbs in Bloom's taxonomy may occur in remember, understand, apply.

**What do you want your students to know?**

Because it happens at the beginning of the lesson, the topic you identify has to be a smaller piece of the larger concepts, topics, or skills.  The topic identified here will support or be part of the broader topic you identify in your summative assessment learning objective, or your assessment of learning.

**What will students do to demonstrate they can think about and use what they will know?**

Because this happens in the beginning, this can be smaller tasks, and may include simple worksheets, anticipation guides, quizzes, socratic discussions, or other forms of getting students started in what will be the larger assessment.

Please note that in a larger lesson or unit, there will be multiple formative assessments, focused on different smaller skills to support that larger one in the summative assessment.
