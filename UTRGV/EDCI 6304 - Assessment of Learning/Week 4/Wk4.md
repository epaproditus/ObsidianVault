# Introduction and Purpose

_***Please note that this project is the third of five that will be combined in your final project during Week 7.   These will be artifacts to upload in your M.Ed digital portfolio.**_

As we continue through the assessment cycle, we reach stage 3. By now, you have planned your summative assessment and have likely made some revision to the assessment of learning objective you originally submitted with your balanced assessment plan.

Because this plan is iterative, we have to look back before we can move forward. The story you want your students to tell must be developed with care, _**but it must connect all the dots**_. This time, we must plan the middle. This is where the conflict, the struggle, and the journey are developed, and when working with formative assessments, they document exactly that.

In this lesson, I will break down the components of your third major project: Formative Assessment Plan. As you review the instructions and parameters, it is very important that you remember to follow them clearly. My style of reviewing projects is very detail-oriented and strict on the guidelines for quality.

If the rubric or the instructions are confusing, please make use of two very important avenues of assistance: Community Questions Forum and Virtual Office Hours.

##  Planning the Middle: Your Purpose in this Project

You know how your lesson or unit will end already: with a PBL summative assessment plan. In this third assessment project, you must build the events in the assessment story that lead to that end. Resolutions don't just happen. There need to be struggles, trial and error, and guidance. That is what your formative assessments will build.

The purpose of this project is to create a formative assessment plan that can be implemented during your lesson or unit, as part of teaching and learning.   You will develop two formative tasks:   1) assessment for learning, and 2) assessment as learning.  

You already got started in the Balanced Assessment Plan by determining objectives for the three purposes for assessment. You will be using and revising the two with formative purposes: assessment for learning and assessment as learning. These will measure progress toward the summative objective and the PBL by breaking down the skills and knowledge needed to get there.

_**This is very important: the two formative assessment types do not use the same tools, nor do they assess the same thing. Don't treat them the same when you plan for them.**_

# What You Will Plan 

A plan for formative assessment is intricately tied to your lesson plan. They happen concurrently because formative assessments are built in checks for learning, one used by the teacher, and the other used by the student.

_**This is the biggest key difference between formative assessment for learning and formative assessment as learning.**_

Just like in the summative assessment, expect to submit descriptions and materials intended for the students. However, because formative assessments are embedded in a lesson, you will also need to submit some explanations that the students don't see, but which serve as your guide or plan of instruction.

Be very cautious that you do not plan these formative tasks in isolation from your summative PBL. _**They are connected.**_

Here is the list of all you will be submitting for this project:

1. Alignments and Objectives
2. Formative assessment for learning, which includes the rubric, checklist or observational record keeping tool.
3. Formative assessment as learning. which includes the rubric, checklist, or reflective journal or interactive notebook template
4. A reflection

# Alignments and Objectives

You have already written two formative objectives, which likely need revision and refinement now that you've planned out the summative assessment. This is a natural process of instructional planning and assessment. Formative objectives get refined.

Therefore, you will be revising and refining your formative objectives by doing the following:

- Address the feedback from your ==Balanced Assessment Plan== to make sure you had all three components of an objective. If you were missing any of them, you will need to revise them.
- Look at your Summative Assessment Plan and make sure that your formative objectives support the processes, thinking, skills, and knowledge that will be used for the larger project. What is important to note is that the summative assessment is broad, and the formative assessments target smaller pieces of the larger one. Therefore, if your formative assessment objectives essentially say the same thing, they need to be refined.
- Consider the standard you selected to align to the summative assessment, and see if it mentions smaller, specific skills that will help you refine your formative assessment objectives so that they better support the learning identified in the summative one.

The bottom line to revising and refining your objectives is to make sure that they help scaffold the learning toward the larger project. If they are just repeating it, then they are not offering proper support of the processes it takes to learn.

## Formative Assessment For Learning Objective

Keep in mind that this learning objective does not change the direction of your main learning objective, but rather focuses on the targeted content or skill that you wish to monitor during the lesson.

The formative for learning then determines what prior knowledge or skills, what knowledge they have or have gained, which they will be able to learn with the processes, thinking, soft skills, or habits of mind you have identified for the formative assessment as learning.

## Formative Assessment As Learning Objective

Keep in mind that this learning objective does not change the direction of your main learning objective, but rather focuses on how a student can _**self-regulate**_ their learning of fundamental skills needed to succeed in the objective.

The formative as learning allows you to identify the processes, thinking, soft skills, or habits of minds the students will need in order to succeed in the summative assessment. You focus on those by trying to get students to make their thinking visible by pulling it out of their heads and describing it through a tool or a written journal.

# Formative Assessment For Learning

Consider what you are teaching your students and anticipate the aspects of your instruction that you feel will give students difficulty in the summative assessment.   Will it be the content itself that will be difficult, or the skills required to learn the content?

## Assessment for Learning Description

You will then describe what you plan to have students do in this formative assessment during the lesson or unit.   These are informal tasks that help students practice the content or the skill you feel will be difficult, depending on what you determine to focus in your formative for learning objective. Whatever informal task you give your students (not a quiz or worksheet), you must be able to keep records of their progress in non-graded, descriptive qualitative data.   If you want some ideas, you can use these two sources to determine which one would work best for you:

- Figure 2.2 Assessment Tool Kit from page 17 in your pdf textbook, "Rethinking Classroom Assessment with Purpose in Mind."   Keep in mind that this kit is a mixture of ideas that can be applied across all three types of assessment, so there are some that are simply not applicable to assessment for learning.  
- 27 Easy Formative Assessment Strategies for Gathering Evidence of Student Learning.   Retrieved from [https://www.nwea.org/blog/2019/27-easy-formative-assessment-strategies-for-gathering-evidence-of-student-learning/](https://www.nwea.org/blog/2019/27-easy-formative-assessment-strategies-for-gathering-evidence-of-student-learning/) .

- The feedback you received for your revised Balanced Assessment Plan should also include guidelines for usability of the initial ideas you submitted for this project.  

- You can also do a general web search of ideas, as long as you do not download a ready-made worksheet or assessment to use as your own (nothing from Teachers Pay Teachers, for instance).   You must create something that works for your students and your learning objectives.  _**You create it.**_

## Rubric, Checklist, Rating Scales, or Observational Note Taking Tool

Your assessment description must contain your plan for record keeping.   If you want formative assessment to count for more than an immediate reaction, you need to keep track. This doesn't mean recording grades. It means recording _**progress**_. So how do you do that?

Here are your options:

- general rubrics for fundamental skills, holistic or analytic (Chapter 4, Brookhart)
- checklists or rating scales (Chapter 7, Brookhart)
- observation note taking tool (Chapter 3, Manitoba)

All of these are teacher-collected or filled out based on a quick review of the student's performance in the formative task. Rubrics for formative assessment should be simple and quick to use as a scoring or progress checking tool. This is intended to be "on the fly" tracking.

You must design the tool in order to make a smooth transition to the next stage of the assessment cycle. In order to demonstrate data literacy in different formats, you must create a different record keeping tool for each of your formative assessments.

You will learn two ways to analyze non-graded formative data. That means one of your tools must be a rubric, checklist, or rating scale, and the other must be text based. In the formative assessment for learning, the text-based data is the observational note taking tool because you write descriptions of what you observe of the students. _**You cannot pick a rubric, checklist, or rating scale for both.**_

# Formative Assessment As Learning

Consider what kind of thinking skills and habits of mind your students need to acquire in order to be successful in the summative assessment.   What are the fundamental or foundational skills that students need to be able to develop to eventually gain independence in the learning objective? What can they reasonably keep track of themselves with some tools given to them by the teacher? What metacognitive mental processes do you need to help them make visible?
## Assessment As Learning Description
You will then describe what you plan to have students do in this formative assessment during the lesson or unit that focuses on fundamental skills, and that helps students keep track of their own learning.     These are informal tasks that help students practice using the fundamental skills, depending on what you determine to focus in your sub-objective.   You must also list the fundamental skills you want your students to track. Whatever informal task you give your students (not a quiz or worksheet), you must give them the ability to keep track of their own progress in non-graded way.   If you want some ideas, you can use these two sources to determine which one would work best for you:
- Figure 2.2 Assessment Tool Kit from page 17 in your pdf textbook, "Rethinking Classroom Assessment with Purpose in Mind."   Keep in mind that this kit is a mixture of ideas that can be applied across all three types of assessment, so there are some that are simply not applicable to assessment as learning.  
- You can also do a general web search of ideas, as long as you do not download a ready-made worksheet or assessment to use as your own (nothing from Teachers Pay Teachers, for instance).   You must create something that works for your students and your learning objectives.  
## Rubric, Checklist, or Record Keeping

Your assessment description must contain your plan for students to keep records of their learning.   If you want formative assessment to count for more than an immediate reaction, you need to give students a tool to keep track. This doesn't mean giving them a grade. It means giving them a way to check their _**progress**_ not the next right answer. So how do you do that?

Here are your options:

- self-evaluation rubrics, general or proficiency-based (Chapters 4 & 5, Brookhart)
- checklists or rating scales (Chapter 7, Brookhart)
- reflections on their habits of mind (p. 23 & Chapter 4, Manitoba)

Do not assign any numerical value to the fundamental skills students will need to track.  

All of these are student described or collected. For instance, if you use a rubric or checklist, the students fill it out to self-evaluate, _**not the teacher.**_ This is all student created for the purpose of describing their own learning, struggles or thinking processes. All he teacher does is build the tool they will use.

You must design the tool in order to make a smooth transition to the next stage of the assessment cycle. In order to demonstrate data literacy in different formats, you must create a different record keeping tool for each of your formative assessments.

You will learn two ways to analyze non-graded formative data. That means one of your tools must be a rubric, checklist, or rating scale, and the other must be text based. In the formative assessment as learning, the text-based data is the student reflections on their habits of mind because they write descriptions of on how they think and are progressing. _**You cannot pick a rubric, checklist, or rating scale for both. The rubric, checklist, and rating scale are in the same category.**_

# How do I Put All This Together?

This assessment project has two audiences, so make sure you use the appropriate structure and descriptions for each. Anything meant for the students, must be written in kid-friendly language, or age appropriate language.

## Alignment and Objectives

The first document will be information about the objectives and the standard. Your document will be a brief table, as indicated below:


![[SCR-20241115-tyjp.png]]

Please make sure you include all the information required, including the row headers indicated. This table will be in a single document.

## Assessment for Learning

The formative assessment for learning should be a new document, which should include the following information:

1. Formative Assessment For Learning Objective
2. A description of the formative assessment for learning in the language you will present it to the students. Include materials that the students will use to complete the task.
3. The record keeping tool you will use to gather the data from the students. This can be a rubric, checklist, rating scale, or observational record keeping tool. All of them require that you submit the tool you create. This tool will be used in the next project for data analysis. Since the teacher uses this tool to do an "on the fly" review of student work, it needs to fit the task, be efficient, and designed to organize information gathered well.

Please note that it is a good idea to create your record keeping tool in a separate document because you will be using it to create data for students, using it once for every student. If you are not currently teaching, you will recreate the data yourself, but this will be further explained in the next project.

## Assessment As Learning

The formative assessment as learning should be a new document, which should include the following information:

1. Formative Assessment As Learning Objective
2. A description of the formative assessment as learning in the language you will present it to the students. Include materials that the students will use to complete the task.
3. The record keeping tool you will design for the students to use and gather their own data. This can be a rubric, checklist, rating scale, or reflective journal or interactive notebook template/prompt. All of them require that you submit the tool you create. This tool will be used in the next project for data analysis. Since the students use this tool to self-evaluate, reflect, or trace their thinking, it needs fit the skills named in the objective. It should also be created with the age of the students in mind, and make it easy for them to use and understand.

Please note that it is a good idea to create your record keeping tool in a separate document because you will be using it to create data for students, using it once for every student. If you are not currently teaching, you will recreate the data yourself, but this will be further explained in the next project.

# Reflection

All good teachers improve by first self-examining their practice and how it fits with your personal philosophy of learning and teaching.   In this reflection, you will talk about your experience designing this formative assessment plan.   How was it different from the types of formative assessments you usually use?   How did it challenge your preconceptions of what a good, quality assessment should be?   How difficult was it for you to create this type of assessment and why?

Write at least two well-developed paragraphs with a thorough reflection.   Double spacing is appreciated, since it makes it easier to read.   Thoroughness of reflection is evaluated, but not length.   However, too short a reflection leaves your thoughts undeveloped, and too long a reflection overdoes it.

Please note that there are some guidelines of this reflection that are similar to the one you wrote for your balanced assessment plan and the summative assessment.   These are repeated, but within the context of this project, so consider your experience building this formative assessment plan and avoid repetition of ideas from previous reflections. Treat every event as if it were unique because it is.

# The Feedback You Will Receive

All project submissions will receive a grade, which isn't final until you decide it is. The grade is determined by the level of quality you demonstrate in the grading rubric. I recommend you review the rubric carefully so that you understand what the expectation of quality will be. Below is a link to the grading rubric, which you can also view in the assignment submission area.

[Formative Assessment Plan Grading Rubric](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c5Bpi0_woWjSxAezk8gaJCNNFFD5OwBR/view?usp=sharing "Formative Assessment Plan Grading Rubric")

Therefore, when you first receive your grade, you should open the rubric to determine how the points were awarded to you. This will help you identify the areas of your project that will benefit from improvement.

However, the grade is not as important as the feedback you will receive. Therefore, if you decide that the quality of your project can be improved, read through the feedback carefully, and you will find guidance on how to improve it. You will then have an opportunity to submit a revised version of your project in the same submission area where you originally submitted. _It is important that a revision be submitted before the next major project because all the projects are connected, and what you do in one, affects what you do in another._

Therefore, always wait for your revisions to be reviewed by me before you dive into the next project. Remember that early birds get feedback and grades faster.
