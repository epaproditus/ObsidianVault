This approach is entirely different from my previous methods of assessing students. The formative assessments I have conducted may not have been accurate, as I primarily focused on identifying misconceptions during their calculations. Introducing a rubric that outlines a defined set of skills for students to demonstrate, along with a self-assessment checklist, has elevated my assessment practices significantly. I now recognize that summative assessments are not the sole type we should rely on; formative assessments promote greater student ownership and provide a clearer understanding of their learning gaps. Although this shift was challenging, I believe that with practice, it will become easier.
