Chapter 3 of "How to Create and Use Rubrics" by Susan M. Brookhart focuses on the process of writing or selecting effective rubrics. The main goal of the chapter is to help educators develop rubrics that will support learning in their classrooms.

## Chapter 3 summary
### Key Points:
1. **Criteria Selection**: The chapter emphasizes that educators should begin by identifying the appropriate criteria that reflect the learning outcomes intended by the task rather than task-specific details. Criteria should be observable, distinct, and appropriate for the learning goal.

2. **Performance Descriptions**: For each criterion, it is essential to create clear performance-level descriptions that indicate varying degrees of quality. These descriptions should focus on observable and specific aspects of students' work rather than using evaluative terms like "excellent" or "good."

3. **Types of Rubrics**: The chapter discusses the difference between general and task-specific rubrics. General rubrics can be applied to a range of similar tasks, while task-specific rubrics are designed for a particular assessment. The advantages of using analytic (assessing each criterion separately) versus holistic (assessing overall quality) rubrics are also analyzed.

5. **Writing Frameworks**: The author provides guidance on how to write effective performance-level descriptions, suggesting that educators consider starting with the expected quality level (e.g., Proficient) and work backward to outline lower performance levels.

6. **Collaborative Development**: The chapter recommends involving students in the rubric creation process to enhance their ownership of the learning criteria. This collaborative effort helps students articulate what constitutes successful performance.

7. **Examples and Applications**: Throughout the chapter, several examples of well-constructed rubrics are shared, providing readers with concrete illustrations of how to implement effective rubric design in various subjects and grade levels.

In summary, Chapter 3 serves as a comprehensive guide for teachers to create effective and supportive rubrics that align with learning goals, enabling both teachers and students to clearly understand the standards of quality expected in student work.

## Types of Rubrics

### 1. General Rubrics for Mathematics
- **Definition**: General rubrics for mathematics provide criteria and performance descriptions that can apply across a range of similar math tasks or skills, such as problem-solving, mathematical reasoning, or data analysis.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Broad Applicability**: They can be used for various assessments involving similar mathematical concepts, such as solving different types of equations, understanding geometric concepts, or applying statistical methods. For instance, a general rubric for mathematical problem-solving could apply to multiple assignments where students analyze word problems.
  - **Learning Focused**: The criteria in general rubrics align with expected learning outcomes in mathematics, helping students understand the skills they need to demonstrate, such as correctly applying formulas or utilizing mathematical vocabulary.
  - **Support for Learning**: These rubrics articulate what high-quality mathematical reasoning looks like, allowing students to self-assess and reflect on their understanding and application of math concepts.
  - **Examples**: An example might be a rubric assessing problem-solving strategies that includes criteria such as understanding the problem, selecting an appropriate method, calculating accurately, and justifying the solution.

### 2. Task-Specific Rubrics for Mathematics
- **Definition**: Task-specific rubrics are designed for a particular math assignment or assessment. They offer detailed criteria and performance levels that relate directly to the specific task at hand.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Narrow Applicability**: These rubrics are specifically tailored for individual assessments and cannot typically be used for other tasks. For example, a rubric for a specific math project on constructing geometric shapes would be relevant only to that project.
  - **Explicit Expectations**: Task-specific rubrics provide detailed criteria that clearly define what is expected for that particular math assignment, such as the steps needed to solve a multi-step equation or requirements for a statistical analysis project.
  - **Efficient for Grading**: They facilitate quicker grading by breaking down the task into identifiable components, allowing the teacher to assess students based on clear right or wrong answers, especially for structured tasks like quizzes or tests.
  - **Examples**: An example could be a rubric for grading a math test question where students solve a word problem involving ratios, detailing expectations for calculation accuracy, explanation of the solution process, and clarity of the final answer.

### Key Differences in a Math Context
- **Flexibility**: General math rubrics are flexible and reusable across similar math tasks, while task-specific rubrics are designed for one particular assignment or test.
- **Focus**: General rubrics emphasize overarching math concepts and processes that students should master, while task-specific rubrics focus on the precise skills and actions needed for a single assessment.
- **Purpose**: General rubrics aim to enhance learning by guiding skill development across assignments, whereas task-specific rubrics provide clarity and specific performance indicators for completing individual assessments effectively.

By applying these distinctions in the context of mathematics, educators can select the appropriate rubric type based on their instructional goals and the specific learning requirements of their students. General rubrics can foster broader skill development in math, while task-specific rubrics can streamline the assessment process for particular assignments.

## Chapter 4 Summary
Chapter 4 of "How to Create and Use Rubrics for Formative Assessment and Grading" focuses on "General Rubrics for Fundamental Skills," emphasizing the importance of establishing clear and effective rubrics that track student development over time, particularly in foundational skills such as writing and mathematics problem-solving.

Key points from Chapter 4 include:

1. **Significance of General Rubrics**: General rubrics provide criteria that are consistent across various tasks and allow students to understand what quality work looks like. They are useful because they highlight the skills and concepts that are being developed, rather than just the tasks themselves.

2. **6+1 Trait Writing Rubrics**: These rubrics have gained popularity for assessing writing by breaking it down into six traits: Ideas, Organization, Voice, Word Choice, Sentence Fluency, and Conventions, plus Presentation. Each trait has clear performance levels, aiding teachers and students in recognizing quality writing and areas for improvement.

3. **Mathematics Problem-Solving Rubrics**: High-quality mathematics problem-solving rubrics typically assess skills like Mathematical Knowledge, Strategic Knowledge, and Mathematical Communication. These dimensions provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating student performance in mathematics.

4. **General Rubrics for Writing and Creativity**: The chapter outlines rubrics for report writing and creativity, pointing out that many existing creativity rubrics often emphasize visual appeal rather than true creative thought processes. The proposed rubrics aim to articulate the characteristics of creative work clearly.

5. **Support for Learning**: The effective use of general rubrics helps students understand what constitutes quality work. They foster improvements in instruction, assessment, and student learning by providing a structured way to gauge progress across multiple contexts.

6. **Examples**: Examples of various rubrics emphasize how they can be structured to support both formative assessments and learning, thus demonstrating their diverse applications in different educational contexts.

In conclusion, Chapter 4 argues that well-designed general rubrics are crucial for fostering skill development. They provide clarity for both teachers and students regarding the learning goals and the quality of work expected, ultimately leading to improved learning outcomes.

# Third Topic

## Stage 3: Plan and Implement Instruction

Stage 3 of the classroom assessment cycle is to plan and implement instruction. This includes formative assessments because they need to be naturally embedded in the teaching and learning. In stage 2 of the classroom assessment cycle, you planned the summative assessment with a written learning objective. This is the target learning that stage 3 supports.![large board announcement | 100x100 ](https://www.softchalkcloud.com/lesson/files/CpzQYWq2OlSKkf/large%20board.png)

Whether you are planning a full unit or just one lesson, the teacher still needs to plan and implement instruction. The teacher makes choices of resources that align to the content of the objective, as well as activities that will help students get through the materials. Whether it involves readings from a textbook, instructional materials, websites, videos, or other materials, they must all be aligned to the objective, and they must all lead the students on the path to being successful in the summative assessment.

For the moment, take a look at the close up of stage 3 in the cycle and the guiding questions you will ask yourself to determine what your formative assessments will be to support your teaching and students' learning
![[Pasted image 20241111205058.png|500x500]]
The guiding questions in stage 3 of the assessment cycle create parameters to plan teaching and formative activities in such a way that learning isn't just supported at the content level, but also at the skill level. Review the tabbed activity below to see how each question describes what happens in planning and implementing.

#### Scaffold
How will you scaffold the thinking level students need to reach and demonstrate in the summative assessment?

You already have a summative assessment with an aligned learning objective. Scaffolding the thinking level in that objective is about looking at the action verb and determining what level in Bloom's taxonomy it targets, hopefully, one of the higher levels. Therefore, how do you create steps or a visible process to guide students in being able to achieve that level of thinking?

#### Empowering students
How will you empower students to self-regulate their own learning?

This question calls attention to student's own ability to determine if they are understanding or not. This is a metacognitive skill that is assessed by the students in a formative assessment as learning task. The teacher's responsibility in this is in providing the guide for what students need to achieve, as well as plan a time for students to keep track.

#### Data Collection & Analysis
How will data be collected and analyzed quickly?

Formative data are gathered informally during instruction, but that doesn't mean that record keeping is careless or non-existent. This question addresses the need for teachers to have a way to keep records quickly and efficiently and be able to make quick determinations (analysis on the fly) of what is happening with student learning.

## Gathering Data from Rubrics and Checklists
The fourth topic for this week is a reading from one of the course books,Â _How to Create and use Rubrics for Formative Assessment and Grading_. As part of this week's readings, you will read chapters 7-8, which describe other alternatives to rubrics that are also useful in specific situations, especially for quick, informal gathering of information.

### Summary of Chapters 7 and 8

#### Chapter 7: Checklists and Rating Scales: Not Rubrics, but in the Family
Chapter 7 distinguishes between rubrics and two other evaluation tools: checklists and rating scales. While rubrics consist of criteria and detailed descriptions of performance quality, checklists simply list specific characteristics to determine whether they are present (yes/no) and rating scales assess the degree to which a characteristic is displayed, either through frequency or quality ratings.

Checklists are particularly useful for:
- Ensuring that assignment requirements are met.
- Evaluating the presence of specific skills or characteristics (e.g., sentences following certain grammatical conventions).

Rating scales, on the other hand, provide a measure of quality or frequency regarding attributes displayed in student work. While they can be effective, the text cautions against confusing rating scales for rubrics, as they typically lack the descriptive performance levels that aid in learning. The chapter emphasizes that checklists and rating scales have important applications but should not replace the more complex and informative nature of rubrics.

#### Chapter 8: More Examples
Chapter 8 provides additional examples of rubrics across various content areas and grade levels, including oral reading fluency, science laboratory reports, and technology education (welding). 

One example discusses an oral reading fluency rubric used by a Title I reading teacher, highlighting how students assess their own reading using specific criteria like expression, phrasing, and speed. This process helps them to understand their progress beyond just tracking words per minute.

The chapter also explores a rubric for science laboratory reports that evaluates elements such as hypothesis formulation, procedure design, data collection, and conclusion drawing. It shows how such rubrics can guide students in understanding the components of effective scientific inquiry and reporting.

Lastly, it examines a welding rubric, illustrating the clarity and descriptive nature of the criteria involved. The author notes that well-constructed rubrics help define learning targets, provide clear expectations, and engage students in self-assessment and improvement.

Overall, Chapter 8 reinforces the importance of effective rubrics as tools that aid not only in grading but also in guiding student learning and self-reflection.
