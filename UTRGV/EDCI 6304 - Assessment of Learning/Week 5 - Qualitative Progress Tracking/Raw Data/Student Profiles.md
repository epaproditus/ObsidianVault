Here is what you need to create your profiles:

- level of knowledge in the subject area you teach or in the unit you selected (whether they struggle or find the subject easy; for reading, if they are at or below grade level)
- language proficiency and competency (whether they have a first language other than English or if they have a learning difficulty, like dyslaxia, dysgraphia, or dyscalculia)
- describe their motivation to learn (do you need to bribe them to learn or generally eager to learn? are they apathetic, don't want to learn or hate school?)
- describe one habit of mind the student finds difficult and one that the student finds easy (see habits of mind table in page 23 of the Manitoba pdf book)
