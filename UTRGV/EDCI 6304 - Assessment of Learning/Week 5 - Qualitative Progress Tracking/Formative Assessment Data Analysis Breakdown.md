###### Stage 4: Classroom Assessment Cycle
# Introduction and Purpose
This project represents stages four and five of the assessment cycle. ==It presents collected data from the assessments, and it analyzes it==. It is in this analysis that the students will tell you their story. Data analysis for formative purposes isn't always about a grade or a number at the end of the task. When you were given your instructions for creating your formative assessment plan in the previous project, it was made clear that you don't create it for a grade but for **_information_**.

That's where your data literacy skills come into play to analyze what you gather from students.

In this lesson, I will break down the components of your fourth major project: Formative Assessment Data Analysis. As you review the instructions and parameters, it is very important that you remember to follow them clearly. My style of reviewing projects is very detail-oriented and strict on the guidelines for quality.
## Deciphering Part of the Story: Your purpose in this Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze qualitative data from formative assessments that were implemented in the classroom or which will be simulated. The data used will be genuine, non-numerical, and continues Stage 3 of the classroom assessment cycle. In your previous project, you created two formative assessments. This step assumes that stage 4 was already completed, by implementing the assessments and gathering student data. In order to complete this project, data are required.

# What You Will Demonstrate in Your Analysis
Data analysis depends on organization, necessitating a record-keeping tool for your formative assessments. This tool helps maintain order and structure in the data.

Data collection may happen in Word documents or with pen and paper, but the analysis takes place in Excel spreadsheets.

The project will include multiple files in Excel and Word, with specific setups for different types of data. There will be a distinction made between raw data, which is unanalyzed and just collected, and analyzed data.

Here is the list of all you will be submitting for this project:

1. Student profiles
2. Formative **_for_** AND **_as_** learning collected assessment data (may be in Word)
3. Formative **_for_** AND **_as_** learning analyzed assessment data (will be in Excel)
4. Instructional Answers to Significant Questions
5. Reflection

What follows is a breakdown of each of these deliverables.

# [[Student Profiles]]

In a standard classroom, teachers carry out planned assessments with students and collect their participation results for grading or assessing progress.

==Teachers need to create [[Student Profiles]] for their grade and subject area to generate assessment data

Here is what you need to create your profiles:

- level of knowledge in the subject area you teach or in the unit you selected (whether they struggle or find the subject easy; for reading, if they are at or below grade level)
- language proficiency and competency (whether they have a first language other than English or if they have a learning difficulty, like dyslaxia, dysgraphia, or dyscalculia)
- describe their motivation to learn (do you need to bribe them to learn or generally eager to learn? are they apathetic, don't want to learn or hate school?)
- describe one habit of mind the student finds difficult and one that the student finds easy (see habits of mind table in page 23 of the Manitoba pdf book)

You will write a brief paragraph that describes all of the above. Writing a paragraph on each student profile will also enable you to make up data about them, if you do not currently have students.

# Formative for AND as Assessment Data Collection: Raw Data Setup

* In the previous project, you outlined a record keeping process for each of your formative assessments, which included various options. 
* In order to match your tool to this analysis, you should have picked one text-based tool, like observations and journals, and one rubric, checklist, or rating scale tool. 
* In this project, you will submit these same record keeping items, but this time they will have data on them, organized by student.

 * These un-analyzed data are considered raw data. This is always your starting point before you start drawing conclusions and determining what this all means.


## Text-Based Data (Observational or Reflective)

* One of your formative assessments should be gathering data that is descriptive, text-based, like an observation tool (from assessment for learning) filled out or a ==free writing reflection journal (from assessment as learning).

### ~~Raw Text-Based Data for Assessment for Learning~~

~~If you planned for an observational tool in your formative assessment for learning, then you will fill it out with real or fake data from your each of the students you included in your ten profiles. The observational notes will be based on the assessment you planned, whether you were watching them write, communicate, problem solve, etc. The notes must focus on how the students performed the task.~~

~~If you selected this text-based option, you will submit this filled out document as part of your raw data.~~

### Raw Text-Based Data for Assessment as Learning (Scale)

If you planned for a reflective journal in your formative assessment as learning, then you will gather journals for all ten of your student profiles. ~~If you've had students in the past who have written these types of journals, you can still some text from them to recreate children's language.~~ ==If you've never had students or don't have journal data, you will have to write ten fake journals that you feel each student, based on their profile, would write. Make them very brief, so that you don't have to write so much. Perhaps 2 or 3 sentences, but keep in mind that these need to show the students expressing how they are learning, not just what they are learning. The purpose is metacognitive or to self-assess.==

If you selected this text-based option, you will submit all ten journals in the same document, but make sure you label each student profile.

## Checklist, Rating Scale, or Rubric (Non-numerical Data)

Formative assessments should incorporate a checklist, rating scale, or rubric, with prior approval necessary before gathering or creating data using these tools.

==For these raw data, you will essentially use the tool to rate or evaluate the work of your ten student, based on how you imagine they will perform based on the profiles you created. You can put the rubric in its own document, and then copy paste it ten times on the same document, so that you can fill it out for each of your students.

Important note on tools for formative assessment as learning: the students fill these out, so make sure you do the best you can to realistically pretend to be each student filling out the tool on their own.

You will submit this document as part of your raw data.

# Formative Assessment for AND as Data Analysis

The analysis of each type of data are different, so that you will need to use the tools and steps that were described during this week's interactive review. Remember that the tools that were used in the example are not going to be exactly like yours.

You will do both analyses in Excel.

Your rating scale, checklist, and rubric **_must match_** the headings of the Excel Spreadsheets, so don't duplicate the example: **_change it to fit your tools._** The essential setup of the worksheets will remain the same, so don't change the orientation of the data.

Do not use the top row in the Excel spreadsheet to include a title. The top row is only for header labels. Put your title in the tab at the bottom or name your file specifically to the title you want. Spreadsheets are for clean data setups, and the don't work the same way as a Word document, which can include a title at the top.

The following link provides you with all the tools that were mentioned and discussed in the interactive review.

Your submission for the data analysis will include two Excel documents with multiple spreadsheets. The instructions guide you on both of these.

# Instructional Answers to Significant Questions

When you do an analsyis of data, you get groupings and patterns that tell you a story about your students. They have to lead to some form of answer to a significant question, or else the data gathering and analysis had no purpose. This is an important part of data literacy: knowing what it says and how to focus what you need from it. You can use a separate Word document for your questions and the instructional answers.

## Significant Questions

First, write significant questions. You planned for two formative assessments. Therefore, you will ask two significant questions, one for each assessment.

You will write your two significant questions by re-reading your objectives and change them into a question each. Do not focus the questions on evaluation (was it right or wrong?) but rather on process or areas of improvement.

## Instructional Answers

Second, you will be answering your own significant questions, based on what your data told you upon analysis. Make a connection between the question you asked and the data results you have. Do not create answers that the data do not show. Intuition has no room here, although it is valuable in other ways.

Once you answer the question, then you explain what your next steps as a teacher are. What do you need to do to address the areas that came up as student needs? Be as specific as possible and don't write generic answers like, "I will provide students more practice time to use polynomials." Instead, say, "Because students had a difficult time setting up variables in polynomial equations, I will lead the class in a practice activity where we take a group of variables and collaboratively determine where they go in an equation and why. This can be a quick sponge activity at the beginning of class or an exit activity."

# Reflection

All good teachers improve by first self-examining their practice and how it fits with your personal philosophy of learning and teaching. In this reflection, you will talk about your experience in analyzing formative, qualitative data. How was it different from past uses of data? How did it challenge your preconceptions of how to analyze data from assessments? How difficult was it for you to analyze data qualitatively? Write at least two well-developed paragraphs with a thorough reflection. Double spacing is appreciated, since it makes it easier to read. Thoroughness of reflection is evaluated, but not length. However, too short a reflection leaves your thoughts undeveloped, and too long a reflection overdoes it.

Please note that there are some guidelines of this reflection that are similar to the one you wrote for your projects. These are repeated, but within the context of this project, so consider your experience building this formative assessment data analysis to avoid repetition of ideas from previous reflections. Treat every event as if it were unique because it is.

# The Feedback You Will Receive

All project submissions will receive a grade, which isn't final until you decide it is. The grade is determined by the level of quality you demonstrate in the grading rubric. I recommend you review the rubric carefully so that you understand what the expectation of quality will be. Below is a link to the grading rubric, which you can also view in the assignment submission area.

[Formative Assessment Data Analysis Grading Rubric](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1feDq3I2f0Aodv4AGGtSNZ3bvzRVI5q9Z/view?usp=sharing "Formative Assessment Data Analysis Grading Rubric")

Therefore, when you first receive your grade, you should open the rubric to determine how the points were awarded to you. This will help you identify the areas of your project that will benefit from improvement.

However, the grade is not as important as the feedback you will receive. This is intended to help guide your learning so that you may improve your work. Therefore, if you decide that the quality of your project can be improved, read through the feedback carefully, and you will find guidance on how to improve it.

You will then have an opportunity to submit a revised version of your project in the same submission area where you originally submitted. _It is important that a revision be submitted before the next major project because all the projects are connected, and what you do in one, affects what you do in another._

Therefore, always wait for your revisions to be reviewed by me before you dive into the next project. Remember that early birds get feedback and grades faster.
