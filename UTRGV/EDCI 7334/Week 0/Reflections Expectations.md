- **Purpose**: Weekly reflections test comprehension of readings and include responses to three essential questions (EQs) detailed in the syllabus. Each submission serves as a reflection on the assigned readings.
- **Format**: The reflections should be written as 1800-2000 word reflective essays, maintaining an 80/20 content ratio of reading material to personal reflection.
- **Grading Rubric**: Assessments cover various criteria, including adherence to APA format, engagement with the course readings, and integration of personal reflections. The rubric categorizes performance into four levels: does not meet expectations, below expectations, meets expectations, and exceeds expectations.
- **Diablogs**: After submitting reflections, students must engage on a discussion board, sharing their work and interacting with classmates. This includes an initial post plus five additional responses, expected to be substantive and well-referenced.
