The document "CPP Traditions" outlines the historical languages of curriculum-pedagogical praxis (CPP), highlighting four main intellectual traditions: **Intellectual Traditionalists**, **Positivist Behaviorists**, **Interpretivist Humanists**, and **Critical Praxeologists**. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The focus is on the dominance (hegemonic status) of the first two</mark>—intellectual traditionalists and positivist behaviorists—in shaping what is considered "common sense" in educational frameworks.

Key points include:
1. **Hegemony of Intellectual Traditionalist and Positivist Behaviorist CPPs**: These approaches dominate the educational landscape, sidelining or erasing alternative CPPs. The document notes: “Intellectual traditionalist and positivist behaviorist CPPs are hegemonic... literally wipe out or exterminate alternative CPPs.”

2. **Intellectual Traditionalism**: This tradition venerates ancient Greek and Roman knowledge, emphasizing subjects that have historical roots in classical education. It promotes a curriculum based on “the Greek paideia,” which justifies the importance of these subjects.

3. **Positivism**: As a critique of intellectual traditionalism, positivism demands that valid knowledge be derived through scientific methods. The document states, “To positivists, intellectual traditionalists’ assumptions about subject areas needed to be scientifically scrutinized.” This leads to the development of a curriculum based on measurable learning objectives.

4. **Combination of Approaches**: The current educational landscape sees a truce between these two traditions, merging traditional subjects with positivist metrics through standardized testing and state standards, as evidenced by: “Hegemonic CPP combines intellectual traditionalist school subjects with positivist standards, data-driven instruction, and standardized tests.”

In essence, the document presents a critical analysis of how these intellectual traditions inform and shape curricular practices, with a focus on the historical context and dominance of intellectual traditionalism and positivism within education.
