#### ***Franklin Bobbitt***
### Summary ###
Franklin Bobbitt's "The Scientific Method of Curriculum-Making" explores the evolution and necessity for an updated educational curriculum that aligns with the complexities of modern society. He argues that as social conditions become increasingly sophisticated, the education system, largely inherited from the 19th century, fails to meet contemporary needs. He emphasizes that past educational methods concentrated on rote memorization but now demand a focus on actual life experiences and critical thinking skills.

Bobbitt observes, "Any inherited system, good for its time, when held to after its day, hampers social progress." He posits that education must adapt urgently to provide both the intelligence and aspirations needed for societal advancement, hence calling for new methods, materials, and visions in education.

One of his core arguments is the need for educational objectives that are specific and grounded in real-world experiences. He notes, "Education that prepares for life is one that prepares definitely and adequately for these specific activities." The curriculum should encompass what students need to know to effectively participate in civic life, maintain health, and solve practical problems. He asserts that "New duties lie before us," indicating the shift from simply conveying facts to developing wisdom through experiential learning.

Bobbitt underscores the importance of utilizing scientific methods for curriculum-making, advocating for a systematic approach to identify the knowledge, skills, and habits necessary for effective performance in various life areas. He writes, "The scientific task preceding all others is the determination of the curriculum," stressing that a well-defined curriculum is foundational to improving education outcomes.

His proposition to analyze the deficiencies in student performances, such as grammatical mistakes and spelling errors, serves as a means to guide curriculum objectives. "Each error discovered is a symptom of grammatical ignorance, wrong habit, imperfect valuation, or careless attitude," which can direct educators to necessary training interventions.

Ultimately, Bobbitt calls for a curriculum that is dynamic and reflective of the best practices in various fields rather than settling for mediocrity. He concludes, "Education is to keep its feet squarely upon the earth; but this does not require that it aim lower than the highest that is practicable," reiterating the need for educational excellence that evolves alongside societal advancements.

### Support for Positivist Language:
>  [[The Scientific Method of Curriculum-Making]] what kind of language does this paper support or reject?

Franklin Bobbitt's "The Scientific Method of Curriculum-Making" primarily supports the **Positivist** language of Curricular-Pedagogical Praxis (CPP). Hereâ€™s how the paper aligns with this language:
1. **Emphasis on Scientific Methods**: Bobbitt advocates for the use of scientific methods in curriculum development, which is a hallmark of the Positivist approach. He argues for a systematic and empirical analysis of educational needs and objectives, focusing on measurable outcomes and data-driven decision-making.

2. **Real-World Relevance**: He stresses the importance of aligning the curriculum with real-world experiences and practical skills necessary for civic life and problem-solving. This focus on empirical relevance and practical application is consistent with Positivist principles.

3. **Objective Curriculum Goals**: Bobbitt calls for specific and well-defined educational objectives grounded in actual life experiences. This aligns with the Positivist emphasis on clarity, objectivity, and the need for curriculum to be informed by observable realities.

### Rejection of Other Languages:
- **Intellectual Traditionalist**: Bobbitt critiques the traditional educational methods that rely heavily on rote memorization, which is characteristic of the Intellectual Traditionalist language. He argues that such methods are outdated and do not meet the complexities of modern society.

- **Interpretivist Experiential**: While he acknowledges the importance of life experiences, his focus on systematic analysis and scientific methods may not fully embrace the Interpretivist emphasis on subjective understanding and the unique contexts of individual learners.

- **Critical Praxeologist**: Although Bobbitt recognizes the need for education to adapt to societal changes, his primary focus on scientific methods and measurable outcomes may not fully engage with the Critical Praxeologist perspective, which emphasizes the political and social contexts of education.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">In summary, Bobbitt's paper supports the Positivist language of CPP by advocating for a scientific, systematic approach to curriculum-making that prioritizes real-world relevance and measurable educational outcomes, while rejecting the limitations of traditional rote learning and other less empirical approaches.</mark> ![[F.BobbittThescientificmethodofcurriculummaking.pdf]]
