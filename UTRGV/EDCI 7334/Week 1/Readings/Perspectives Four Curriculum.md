## Summary
---
**1. Introduction of Curriculum Perspectives:**
William H. Schubert sets the stage for the discussion on curriculum by pointing out that many educators associate curriculum exclusively with textbooks. He emphasizes that pioneering theorists like John Dewey recognized that curriculum encompasses much more.

*Quote:* "Since the advent of graded textbooks...when many educators and most noneducators hear the term curriculum, they think of textbooks."

---

**2. The Nature of Curriculum:**
Schubert discusses the essence of curriculum, framing it as the inquiry into what knowledge is worth acquiring. He connects this question to the broader philosophical issues of justice and the concept of the ‘journey of learning.’

*Quote:* "The study of curriculum, taken seriously, invokes questions of the good life for individuals and matters of justice in pursuing life together."

---

**3. Curricular Positions:**
He identifies four recurrent positions in curriculum theory: intellectual traditionalist, social behaviorist, experientialist, and critical reconstructionist, arguing that these collectively provide a comprehensive framework that transcends textbook-centric views.

*Quote:* "I have identified four recurrent positions on curriculum thought, which I have labeled as intellectual traditionalist, social behaviorist, experientialist, and critical reconstructionist."

---

**4. Intellectual Traditionalist Perspective:**
The intellectual traditionalist argues for a curriculum grounded in classical literature and organized disciplines, asserting that understanding great ideas promotes deep reflection on universal human concerns.

*Quote:* "The best answers to the basic curriculum question (What is worth knowing?) are found in the great works and in the organized disciplines of knowledge."

---

**5. Social Behaviorist Perspective:**
In contrast, the social behaviorist emphasizes evidence-based curriculum design that focuses on real-world skills and knowledge appropriate for today’s students, critiquing the outdated reliance on traditional textbooks.

*Quote:* "Textbooks of today carry little more than redigested relics of past textbooks, and the same unquestioned curriculum is passed from generation to generation."

---

**6. Experientialist Perspective:**
The experientialist promotes a curriculum that arises from students' interests and experiences, advocating for learning that is meaningful and stems from personal relevance rather than a contrived, traditional structure.

*Quote:* "I want you to think of a skill you have...how and where you acquired the skill, or body of knowledge, or guiding value."

---

**7. Critical Reconstructionist Perspective:**
The critical reconstructionist views schools as perpetuating social inequalities and advocates for curricula that educate students about injustice and empower them to become activists and change agents in society.

*Quote:* "Students should learn to become activists who strive to overcome injustices that they face, attending carefully to the consequences of their actions."

---

**8. Conclusion:**
Schubert concludes by stressing that educators should integrate insights from all four curriculum perspectives rather than favoring one over the others, promoting a holistic approach to curriculum development.

*Quote:* "The fundamental question is not merely whether to have textbooks, but to ask continuously what should be done and why it should be done."
