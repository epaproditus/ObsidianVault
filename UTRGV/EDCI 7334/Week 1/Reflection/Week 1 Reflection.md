**What are Historical Curricular-Pedagogical Languages (CPP), and from these languages, what should we retain?**

As education continues to change, it’s important to look at how we can learn from the past. Historical approaches to teaching, known as curricular-pedagogical languages, have shaped how we educate students today. These include intellectual traditionalism, positivism, interpretivist-experiential approaches, and critical praxeology. By examining these four approaches, we can identify valuable components to create a more effective and relevant curriculum for today’s students.

William H. Schubert uses a clever method to discuss four curriculum traditions by personifying each one, allowing them to express their views in conversation. The Intellectual Traditionalist asserts, “The best answers to the basic curriculum question are found in the great works and in the organized disciplines of knowledge” (Schubert, 1996, p. 170). This highlights the importance of foundational knowledge. The Social Behaviorist responds with a practical viewpoint: “Curriculum and instruction are intertwined, but I like to distinguish them by saying curriculum is the what and instruction is the how” (Schubert, 1996, p. 171). This emphasizes the need for clear educational goals. The Experientialist, valuing personal experiences, passionately states, “The proper subject matter of a curriculum is any experience that is educative” (Schubert, 1996, p. 172), showcasing the importance of tailoring education to individual contexts. Finally, the Critical Reconstructionist insists, “Students should learn to become activists who strive to overcome injustices that they face” (Schubert, 1996, p. 173), calling for a curriculum that empowers students to address societal issues. Through this lively dialogue, Schubert illustrates the distinct values of each tradition, encouraging educators to reflect on how these perspectives can enrich their teaching practices.

While Schubert's dialogue among the curriculum traditions is engaging and thought-provoking, it also reveals significant tensions inherent in educational philosophies, each advocating for different priorities in teaching and learning. The Intellectual Traditionalist asserts, “Let us proceed step by step to master each one of these separate parts, and at last he will have covered the entire ground” (Schubert, 1996, p. 170). This perspective emphasizes a structured, content-focused curriculum that often stands in contrast to the Experientialist’s belief in the importance of personal relevance and active learning. The Experientialist argues, “Learning is active. It involves reaching out of the mind” (Schubert, 1996, p. 173), highlighting the need for education that engages students with their own experiences.

The Social Behaviorist enters the discussion advocating for data-driven practices, emphasizing, “Curriculum must start with a clear definition of what is needed to achieve success in our world” (Schubert, 1996, p. 171). However, this focus on objective measurement can overlook the richness of individual student experiences that the Interpretivist tradition champions. The Interpretivist shares, “We must understand that the good school is concerned with every kind of learning that helps students grow” (Schubert, 1996, p. 174), emphasizing that meaning-making and context are essential components of effective education.

Similarly, the Critical Reconstructionist highlights the importance of social issues, stating, “Education must be a form of activism. It is not enough to inform; we must empower students” (Schubert, 1996, p. 175). This call for social justice can create tension with the Intellectual Traditionalist, who may prioritize cultural heritage over the urgent need for equity and change in educational structures.

In addition to Schubert's dialogue, the writings of other influential educators reveal significant tensions within curricular-pedagogical praxis. Franklin Bobbitt emphasizes the importance of employing a scientific approach to curriculum development, arguing that “effective methods and evaluation are essential for improving education” (Bobbitt, 2021, p. 11). This focus on measurable outcomes aligns with the Social Behaviorist’s emphasis on accountability but can create tension with experiential approaches that value individual student contexts. The reliance on data may overlook the qualitative aspects of learning, leading educators to prioritize test scores over deeper understanding and engagement, illustrating potential shortcomings of a purely positivist perspective.

William Torrey Harris, as described by Sniegoski, advocated for a curriculum deeply rooted in classical knowledge, asserting that “the accumulated wisdom of Western civilization should guide our educational practices” (Sniegoski, 1990, p. 2). This traditionalist viewpoint can conflict with the Critical Reconstructionist approach that demands a focus on social equity and justice within the curriculum. While Harris maintains the importance of a strong intellectual foundation, his insistence on classical content may limit the inclusion of diverse perspectives that reflect today’s multicultural society and the evolving aims of education.

The aims of education, as discussed by Oliva and Gordon, present essential considerations for contemporary curricula. They highlight that “education must equip students to cope with their environment and become responsible citizens” (Oliva & Gordon, 2019, p. 121). This perspective aligns well with the ideals of the Critical Reconstructionist, who advocates for education as a means of promoting social responsibility and activism. However, integrating such aims must be balanced with the rigorous content expectations of the Intellectual Traditionalist, illustrating yet another dimension of tension in curriculum development. 

The integration of the Carnegie Curriculum for Mathematics in my classroom has highlighted a significant tension between innovative teaching methods and the constraints of standardized testing, particularly the STAAR assessments. While Carnegie emphasizes the importance of active learning and real-world application—encouraging students to engage deeply with mathematical concepts—the STAAR test typically prioritizes rote memorization and procedural skills. For instance, Carnegie promotes the idea that “learning is an active process” (Carnegie Learning, n.d.), allowing students to explore mathematics through collaborative problem-solving. However, when preparing for the STAAR test, students often find themselves focusing on isolated skills and strategies that do not resonate with their daily experiences.

This disconnection becomes evident in classroom dynamics, where students’ frustration mounts as they navigate the demands of the STAAR test, which often lacks relevance to the engaging lessons they’ve experienced. The rigorous academic standards associated with Intellectual Traditionalism emphasize mastery of content, yet the testing environment can reduce the richness of learning to mere compliance with standardized formats. This situation creates a complex landscape where educators must balance the expectations of academics with the realities of testing, often leading to a curriculum that feels more like a series of hurdles rather than a cohesive journey of understanding.

William H. Schubert's dialogue among the curriculum traditions brings to life the unique contributions each approach offers to education. The Intellectual Traditionalist, with a tone of authority, proclaims, “Education should focus on the great works of literature and science to develop critical thinkers who can navigate complex ideas” (Schubert, 1996, p. 170). This assertion reflects the promise of fostering strong analytical skills in students, equipping them to tackle challenging problems both in and out of the classroom.

In response, the Experientialist adds an enthusiastic note, declaring, “Learning is active. It involves reaching out of the mind” (Schubert, 1996, p. 173). This perspective emphasizes that practical, hands-on learning experiences are crucial for students to connect meaningfully with the material. The Experientialist believes that when students engage with real-world applications, they not only understand concepts better but also develop a genuine interest in learning.

The Social Behaviorist interjects with a practical viewpoint, stating, “Curriculum must start with a clear definition of what is needed to achieve success in our world” (Schubert, 1996, p. 171). This focus on clarity and measurable outcomes can guide educators in developing standards that ensure all students gain the essential skills they need for future success. By providing a structured pathway for learning, the Social Behaviorist underscores the importance of accountability in education while still valuing diverse approaches to teaching.

Finally, the Critical Reconstructionist brings a sense of urgency to the conversation, insisting, “Education must be a form of activism. It is not enough to inform; we must empower students” (Schubert, 1996, p. 175). This perspective emphasizes the need for education to serve as a catalyst for social change, urging educators to design curricula that engage students in addressing societal issues. By fostering a sense of agency and social responsibility, the Critical Reconstructionist highlights the transformative power of education.

Through this rich dialogue, Schubert illustrates that each curricular tradition contributes valuable insights and practices to modern education. While the Intellectual Traditionalist provides the necessary rigor, the Experientialist ensures relevance, the Social Behaviorist promotes accountability, and the Critical Reconstructionist emphasizes social justice. By integrating these strengths, educators can create a curriculum that is not only academically rigorous but also meaningful and empowering for students.
