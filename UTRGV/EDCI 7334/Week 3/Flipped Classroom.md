Flipped classroom instruction

for inclusive learning

Lisa Altemueller and Cynthia Lindquist

The flipped classroom is a teaching methodology that has gained

recognition in primary, secondary and higher education settings. The

flipped classroom inverts traditional teaching methods, delivering lec-

ture instruction outside class, and devoting class time to problem solv-

ing, with the teacher’s role becoming that of a learning coach and

facilitator. This methodology provides an avenue for more hands-on and

student-driven learning during class time. The benefits of a flipped

classroom include increased student motivation, differentiating instruc-

tion, self-pacing lessons and mastery learning, increased collaboration

and instant feedback for formative assessment. Although limited

research has been conducted regarding students with learning difficul-

ties in inclusive settings using a flipped learning model, initial research

indicates flipping a classroom can be beneficial. Information is provided

on inclusive practices from numerous countries that are beneficial to

students with learning difficulties, as well as strategies and resources

for individuals who may want to implement a flipped classroom.

The flipped classroom, or, as some have termed it, the inverted classroom, is a

teaching methodology that inverts traditional teaching methods, delivering lecture

instruction outside the class while class time is devoted to problem solving and

application of lecture content. The teacher’s role shifts to that of learning coach

and facilitator. The flipped classroom provides an avenue for more hands-on and

student-driven learning during class time. This model has existed in various for-

mats over recent years, with credit for the term ‘flipped’ most often given to two

teachers, Jonathan Bergmann and Aaron Sams at Woodland Park High School in

Sams used software to prepare PowerPoint presentations and recorded and posted

live lectures online for students who missed class. The online lectures started to

spread, while Bergmann and Sams were asked to speak to teachers around the

country about their methods. Teachers began using online videos and video pod-

casts to teach students outside class, reserving time for collaborative work and

mastery exercises during class sessions. Bergmann and Sams (2012) describe

flipping the classroom as being about a mindset of redirecting attention away

from the teacher and putting attention on the learner and the learning.

The purpose of this article is to provide information on inclusive practices in flip-

ping instruction that are beneficial to students with learning difficulties from

numerous countries, as well as to provide strategies and resources for individuals

who may want to implement this teaching methodology.

Although the concept started in the general education, high school setting, it has

garnered attention in various venues, including special education. Educators are

investigating surprising benefits of this innovative way of teaching, such as its

effect on students with special needs. Some of the benefits of a flipped classroom

include differentiating instruction, self-pacing lessons and mastery learning,

increased collaboration and instant feedback for formative assessment.

Literature review

Studies of student perception

A study comparing the flipped classroom with a conventional method of teaching

trigonometry examined the effectiveness of the flipped classroom learning envi-

ronment on the student’s learning achievement and motivation. The research was

accomplished through a pre-test/post-test quasi-experimental design. The 82 high

school students who participated in the study were divided into experimental and

control groups. The findings of the study indicated a significant difference in the

learning achievement and motivation of students in the flipped classroom envi-

ronment, with students being highly satisfied and positive about the flipped class-

room. The results indicated that in this study, the flipped classroom was better

than the teacher-centred approach in the conventional method of teaching, and

the flipped classroom benefited lower achievers more than high and average

achievers (Bhagat et al., 2016).

A study of student perceptions of a flipped classroom in general, video as a learn-

ing tool, and Moodle learning management system as a supporting tool, found

the majority of the students had a positive attitude toward flipped classrooms,

facilitate online instruction). The positive attitude toward the flipped classroom

was strongly correlated with perceptions of increased motivation, engagement,

increased learning and effective learning. In this study of 240 university students,

low achievers were significantly more positive than high achievers in their atti-

tudes toward the use of video as a learning tool (Nouri, 2016).

Differentiating instruction

Differentiating instruction is crucial in meeting the needs of students with learn-

ing difficulties (Tucker, 2012b). In fact, by 2020 differentiated instruction will

not distinguish a teacher as effective but will merely be a part of every lesson,

every day (Blake-Plock, 2011). General education teachers have responsibility

for teaching students with learning difficulties, gifted students, and students with

no identified exceptionality six hours a day, 180 days a year, in US classrooms.

On top of struggling to achieve the Common Core Curriculum and/or meet state

standards, teachers are being asked to differentiate instruction for each and every

learner. The reality for many teachers is that it is difficult to put into practice.

Flipping the classroom can assist teachers in differentiating instruction to meet

the needs of students with learning difficulties.

A huge benefit of flipping is that the students who struggle get the most help.

Bergmann and Sams (2012) noted that the role of the teacher changes from that

of a presenter of information to that of a learning coach. This allows the teacher

to spend additional time working one-on-one or in small groups, which is an

effective way to meet the needs of students with learning difficulties. The amount

of classroom time spent interacting, both student-to-teacher and student-to-

student, is increased in a flipped classroom. Students with learning difficulties

who need additional time interacting with the teacher in order to learn receive

this additional time. This modification of the traditional classroom will allow for

more differentiation in the classroom.

Additionally, the teacher can intentionally plan the class activities to align with

multiple levels of student achievement. In other words, the teacher can implement

tiered activities in the flipped classroom. Tiered activities allow students the

opportunity to work with the same content, essential ideas and skills, but with

varying degrees of ability and complexity. Tomlinson (2014) outlines a method

for creating tiered activities that includes cloning assignments on a continuum

visualised as a ladder, with the top rung being the students with the most

advanced understanding of the topic. Utilising a flipped classroom teaching

with scaffolds for a variety of learner levels (Tomlinson, 2014).

Differentiating instruction can also include the use of assistive technology for stu-

dents with various learning difficulties. Assistive technology can be a powerful

tool in allowing students with special needs to participate fully with their peers.

Gray, managing director for PowerUp WHAT WORKS!, a product of the Center

for Technology Implementation, states that although classroom technology can

typically be used by a wide group of learners, assistive technology for the flipped

classroom needs to be more individualised. Gray cautions that it is important to

look at what works for whom and under what conditions (McCrea, 2014). The

technology tools to personalise the instruction exist, but we also need to focus on

the individual needs of students and consider the rates at which they acquire

information and knowledge.

Some of the assistive technologies that can be accessed by students with learning

difficulties include captioning applications, text-to-speech software, word process-

ors with speech synthesis and alternative keyboards. In general, assistive technol-

ogy can help compensate for a skill deficit and provides one more way in which

instruction can be differentiated.

Self-pacing lessons and mastery learning

Additionally, flipping the classroom adds flexibility to the classroom setting,

extending learning far beyond the traditional lesson, and allows for self-paced,

mastery learning (Tucker, 2012b). All the direct instruction is recorded; students

with learning difficulties can watch the videos as many times as needed to learn

the material. Students are no longer forced to copy down notes anxiously, in the

hope that they will understand them later. Instead, students can pause and rewind

lessons as needed, to make sure they actually learn the important concepts (Berg-

mann & Sams, 2012). Utilisation of video instruction outside the classroom

allows students who learn more quickly to watch the video and move to chal-

lenging content, and allows students who are struggling to watch the video

repeatedly to solidify learning.

In the Byron School District in Minnesota, financial challenges led the school

district to develop their own high school mathematics curriculum instead of pur-

chasing new textbooks, which resulted in a focus on mastery learning through

flipping the classroom. In the process they re-examined state standards, reviewed

student test data indicating areas of challenge, previewed resources pulled from

the Internet and implemented the flipped model. Byron teachers shared their top

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licensereasons for adopting a flipped classroom. Allowing students to progress at their

individual pace was expressed as an important component. The Byron High

School teachers indicated that students attend each lesson via the homework

video. Students ready for more advanced content or who learn faster can proceed

while others can watch multiple times as needed until the concepts become clear.

The teachers suggest this process allows students to review and preview materials

as necessary, which gives the student control over their learning (Fulton, 2012).

In an interview, Sams stated:

‘What we’re finding these days is that a lot of teachers are using the

flipped classroom model as just an entry point, but no one really stops

there. If kids want to work ahead, they’ve got all the instructional content

they need. And teachers’ time can be freed up to help the students who

struggle.’

(Jackson, 2013, n.p.)

Sams explains that the model used at Byron is a version of the flipped mastery

model based on work by Benjamin Bloom, a prominent educational psychologist.

Bloom believed that most students are able to reach mastery if given enough time.

With digital video, content delivery is much less of an issue, and students can

review things multiple times if necessary. Students watch and learn in an asynchro-

nous system in which they work toward content mastery (Jackson, 2013).

The central idea behind mastery learning is that the student must complete all

work to a specified standard before moving on or receiving credit. The specified

criteria may need to be modified depending on the flexibility of the curriculum or

district expectations. Seigel (2013) describes that students in his science course

have the option of resubmitting work that falls below his classroom benchmark of

65%. Failing work is returned to the student, mistakes are corrected and additional

study is done on an alternative version of the assignment. Students are forced to

gain a better understanding of the material before a grade is entered in the grade

book. The expectation is that students examine their mistakes and correct miscon-

ceptions before moving on to more difficult work (Seigel, 2013). This approach to

teaching is an effective and efficient way to teach content, especially in diverse

classroom environments where students have a range of learning preferences.

When Bergmann and Sams (2013) first attempted to implement mastery learning

with a classroom of students who were achieving mastery of objectives at

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licensesignificantly different rates, they recognised that they needed to reorganise their

list of objectives for each grading period to ‘front load’ the essential ones. Then,

if a student worked at a slower pace, he or she would not miss the essential

objectives, only the ‘nice to know’ ones.

This self-pacing, mastery model also gives choices to students. Bergmann and

Sams (2012) have stated that flipping enabled them to move from a lecture-based

classroom model to a learner-centred, problem-based, inquiry-driven hub of learn-

ing. When the teachers gained the additional class time, they re-evaluated every

assignment and its place in the curriculum and included optional videos. Students

were given choices in how they preferred to learn the content. Most of the stu-

dents selected to watch the videos, but others preferred to learn from their text-

books or from online simulations (Bergmann & Sams, 2012). The teachers have

essentially transferred the responsibility for learning to the students, which is the

essence of a flipped classroom.

Increased collaboration and co-operative learning

Another benefit to flipped classroom instruction is increased student collaboration

and co-operative learning. In an interview, Prupas, head of inov8 Educational

Consulting, a firm engaged in consultation in special education and technology,

asserts that the most effective approach for flipping the classroom for special edu-

cation students is not vastly different from the approach that is effective for gen-

eral education students (Schaffhauser, 2013). Her philosophy is that instead of

doing things differently we really have to do different things. Prupas believes the

real benefit of the flipped classroom lies in the collaborative and active learning

aspects of the classroom. For example, if a student with autism needs to work on

social skills specifically, a flipped classroom allows the teacher to focus on social

skills by setting up activities that are team-oriented and collaborative. In this

example, the instructional videos might show social skills and then, in the class-

room, the students would work together on the skills (Schaffhauser, 2013). Stu-

dents are helping each other learn instead of relying on the teacher as the

exclusive disseminator of knowledge.

Additional studies examining co-operative learning, collaboration and the flipped

classroom model have been conducted in the higher education setting. One study

in Norway (Foldnes, 2016) investigated two implementations of the flipped class-

room. The first implementation did not actively encourage co-operative learning

and students progressed through the course at their own pace, while the second

implementation was organised with co-operative learning activities. In the first

implementation, student examinations scores did not differ between traditional

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licenselectures and the flipped classroom. In the second study, class time was structured

to allow for co-operative learning, and active learning was implemented through

co-operative teamwork. The second implementation used randomised control-

group pre-test/post-tests. Student scores on the post-test and on the final examina-

tion were significantly higher for the flipped classroom group than for the control

group receiving traditional lectures (Foldnes, 2016).

Co-operative learning in the flipped classroom can also promote individual

accountability within groups. For example, a jigsaw approach can be utilised

within a group-learning situation. An individual student can be made accountable

for his or her own learning and then assume responsibility for the learning of

others within his or her group (Ray & Powell, 2014).

One university professor began flipping his higher education classroom in a quest

to remain relevant, and acknowledged that his true value to students came from

interactive personal mentoring. He concluded that the most meaningful instruc-

tion imitated the real world; that in the working world we collaborate with col-

leagues and success is defined by our ability to work with others to resolve

common challenges using the available resources. His classroom set-up required

students to accept responsibility for completing preparatory lessons on time to

allow their productive participation in the weekly team learning activities, and

not simply show up to absorb a lecture or freeload from classmates who com-

pleted assigned background material. The instructor stated that peer pressure and

credit for timely completion effectively reinforced this real world expectation

(Gunyou, 2015).

Immediate feedback

Another valuable aspect of the flipped classroom is the immediate feedback that

can be given to students. The dedicated face-to-face time allows teachers to work

with students and catch misunderstandings and misconceptions. Informal forma-

tive assessments are happening continually. The students no longer have to wait

for feedback on their learning.

Vanderkam (2013) asserts that feedback requires a lot of work from teachers.

Using the example of the classic saying that ‘practice makes perfect’, she adds

that it cannot be just any kind of practice. To see real improvement, the author

believes that deliberate practice is needed and involves figuring out exactly what

is known and unknown (Vanderkam, 2013). When professional athletes want to

improve their skills, they have coaches who spend long hours watching and giv-

ing intensive feedback.

ties and learning styles, similar to those coaching sessions of athletes. Instead of

waiting to mark homework that has been done incorrectly, mistakes can be cor-

rected immediately. Teachers can move from student to student, watching, listen-

ing and noting who needs help, and can work with students who need assistance.

Faulkner, a high school teacher, notes that if several students are struggling with

a problem, he might work through more problems on the board for the whole

class, and the flexibility and real-time analysis allows for a true and immediate

response to student needs (Fulton, 2012).

Flipped teaching techniques provide students the opportunity to think critically.

Students ask questions of the facilitator and other students when working in team

activities, which provide immediate feedback on their learning. This benefits both

their successes and their mistakes (James et al., 2014).

International response to flipping and other blended learning

The New Media Consortium Horizon Report 2015 K-12 Edition (Johnson et al.,

2015) examined emerging trends and technologies that will potentially drive edu-

cational change in schools worldwide. The research and discussions of 56 educa-

tion and technology experts from 22 countries and six continents contributed to

the report. One trend noted was the increased use of blended, flipped classroom

learning, drawing on best practice in online and face-to-face methods. The report

affirmed that:

‘When designed and implemented effectively, hybrid models allow

students to practise and achieve mastery of content at their own pace via

online learning modules and adaptive software. Teachers are then freed

up to focus on small groups of students who need more support to

succeed.’

(Johnson et al., 2015, p. 16).

European Schoolnet (n.d.) is a network of 31 European Ministries of Education,

whose mission is to help schools use educational technologies effectively by

equipping teachers and students with the skills to achieve in society. Thousands

of schools have been engaged in pilot projects and studies, testing new learning

activities and technologies in the classroom. One project co-ordinated by Euro-

pean Schoolnet was the Creative Classrooms Lab (CCL) Project (2013). This

study brought together teachers and policy-makers in eight countries and 45

schools. Early evidence from the project suggested that flipped learning was

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licensechanging the mode of in-class instruction. The CCL Project was used, in part, to

monitor the results of flipped learning and to collect quantitative and qualitative

data on how the use of tablet computers in flipped classrooms affected the learn-

ing progress of different types of students, including under-performing students.

The CCL Project was also used to assess changes in the attitudes of teachers, and

to track parental involvement (Thompson, 2013).

The webinar ‘Tablets and flipped classroom’ (Lima & Cuccurullo, 2015) pre-

sented the results of two of the studies in the CCL Project. Lima, a Portuguese

lead teacher for CCL, documented his research on flipping a first grade classroom

(ages six to seven), which included the challenges of parents’ reluctance to

embrace the flipped model, the lack of resources, and problems with technology.

Benefits included increased excitement about learning, more collaborative work,

and the exploration of new learning approaches. In Lima’s two-year study, the

second year witnessed greater success, with students becoming more independent

learners. Students were more confident in the use of technology and this was evi-

dent in their final written work. The webinar also highlighted the work of Cuc-

curullo, a secondary teacher and university instructor from Naples, Italy.

Cuccurullo shared her learning from two years of work using iPads in a flipped

classroom setting. She viewed the flipped classroom as an inversion of roles and

flipping allowed her to extend learning beyond class through individual and col-

laborative practice.

Two additional studies were presented in the CCL webinar, ‘Special needs educa-

tion and tablets’ (Engelhardt et al., 2015). As a co-author of the webinar, Ianna-

cone’s contribution included the research being conducted on EdiTouch tablets,

which were created in Italy to assist children with special educational needs and

specific learning difficulties. A scientific trial was conducted from 2012 to 2014

with more than 400 students aged eight to 14 who were identified as having a

specific learning disability. The tablets were equipped with special programme

for reading books with text to speech, a calculator voice, and software to create

concept maps. In the same webinar, Cranmer shared a pilot study conducted in

the UK through Lancaster University concerning young people with visual

impairments in mainstream schools and the use of digital technologies for learn-

ing. The study involved seven secondary school students and one primary school

student with a visual impairment, and the use of HP Envy, iPad and iPod Touch

devices. Students received documents and presentations prior to lessons, and

iBooks for textbooks were downloaded through load2learn. Students were able to

magnify text on their tablet and take photos of board work, allowing them to be

more self-directed and work independently. Students reported feeling less

son’ (Engelhardt et al., 2015). The study emphasised the importance of access to

the same online opportunities for those with visual impairments as their peers for

learning, leisure and work.

Two Belgian professors have created a web site that provides instruction and con-

crete examples in French for teaching mathematics concepts. Their web site

‘Inverse Math’ is designed to provide resources for teachers using the flipped

classroom method (Viatour & Beguin, n.d.).

Europe is not alone in implementing flipped or other forms of blended learning.

SPARK Schools (n.d.) network is an emerging blended learning model that is

being implemented in some African primary schools. The blended school day is

divided between teacher-led instruction and personalised, online learning enabled

by adaptive software. The model includes a learning lab rotation model where stu-

dents spend 90 minutes per day engaged in mathematics and language arts with

tutor assistance and with 20 minutes allocated during the lab for small-group or

one-on-one work. SPARK Schools intend to continue expanding the programme,

with the goal of offering affordable private education in 60 schools by 2020.

The flipped classroom is still relatively new in China, but is developing quickly

(Yang, 2014). Yang sees the flipped classroom as an educational idea that facili-

tates learner autonomy, encourages co-operative learning and presents parents

with more educational responsibilities. The flipped classroom is allowing educa-

tors the opportunity to improve their teaching efficiency and raise learner

autonomy through inquiry-based learning (Yang, 2014).

In New Zealand, Clement (2014) reports that although flipping is gaining popu-

larity in secondary schools, it has been slow to take off in primary and intermedi-

ate schools. Concern has been raised that flipping has certain fad-like qualities;

however, it is making dramatic improvements in some classrooms, particularly in

relation to behaviour. Some issues that teachers need to consider, according to

Clement (2014), include bridging the digital divide (since a number of students

do not have access to technology at home); understanding that flipped homework

is still homework; allowing time for physical activity and play outside school;

and designating time for teachers to create the resources.

While flipping the classroom is still a relatively new concept, researchers are

amassing support for using the model to enhance learning in the classroom for all

students. Flipping the classroom has assisted teachers in increasing differentiation

Strategies and tools for implementation

Overcoming flipped classroom concerns

Once the decision has been made to implement the flipped classroom model, one

of the most commonly expressed concerns relates to students who may not have

access at home to the technology often used in a flipped classroom. Home access

to computers and the Internet has expanded dramatically; almost 57% of children

aged three to 17 use the Internet at home and 79% have a computer in the home

(Child Trends, 2013). Children’s access to computers at home and their home

Internet use was positively related to household income in the Child Trends (2013)

study, but alternative solutions to access can be achieved through various means.

Schools with large lower-income populations have been experimenting with

ways to deliver content before or after school in the library or a classroom, on

students’ own mobile devices, on various mobile devices that can be borrowed

from the school, or burned onto DVDs for students who have access to a DVD

player but not to the Internet at home (Finkel, 2012). Nesloney (2014), a teacher

of fifth-grade pupils (aged 10 to 11) who presents webinars on flipped learning

for students and teachers, has expressed that he has made effective use of flash

drives, DVDs, iPods and iPod Nanos, as well as before- and after-school sessions

with great success in his school. There is no doubt that addressing the technology

needs of the students and the school is an important process, but one that has

been successfully addressed in multiple school settings with students from all

socio-economic groups.

Another concern is that flipping devalues the role of the teacher. Many teachers

using the flipped model have expressed the sentiment that flipping has made

them a better teacher. Greenberg et al. (2011), after completing a summer pilot

study on blended learning involving Envision Schools, Google and Stanford Uni-

versity, wrote:

‘We remain convinced that teachers will be at the center of the blended

learning movement. Rather than replace teachers, we see blended learning

as potentially transforming or redefining the role of teacher back to its

Socratic origins.’

(Greenberg et al., 2011, p. 23)

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseGetting started with flipping the classroom

The fundamentals of the flipped classroom revolve around the idea of delivering

lectures and other traditional classroom learning content as homework then using

classroom time to do what used to be assigned as homework, providing addi-

tional instruction to students during class sessions. This blended learning encom-

passes any use of technology to leverage the learning and is commonly done by

– but in no way limited to – using teacher-created videos that the students view

outside class time. There are many ways to approach this. The Flipped Learning

Network and Flipped PD web sites are great resources for those wanting informa-

tion on the basics of setting up a flipped classroom.

Many teachers already differentiate some of their instruction and many already

use multimedia resources. Adapting materials for use in a flipped classroom is

manageable and a good starting point for novices. For example, if you already

use PowerPoint slides or other digital materials, there are tools such as

Screencast-O-Matic or Jing in which one can easily record voice-overs for these

materials to create a self-contained lecture. Additionally, the narration tool in

PowerPoint can be utilised to record narration for existing presentations.

Tapping into pre-existing, publicly shared content is another efficient way to get

started. With the wealth of free, readily available resources that are ready to use,

it is worth exploring the web sites of Khan Academy, Ted-Ed and Teacher Tube.

Edmodo and Schoology are examples of free learning management systems

where instructors can store and share content and resources.

Table 1 provides a concise listing of resources available for incorporating materi-

als you already use and utilising pre-existing content into a flipped model. The

purpose of the table is to assist novice users in locating readily available, free or

low-cost tools and materials.

It is important to start small when beginning to move to a flipped classroom. It

is possible to change one lesson per term, or collaborate with a colleague and

double one’s productivity. An example of this kind of collaboration can be

seen in a pilot project in Stillwater, Minnesota, where more than 30 classes

in the district began using the flipped concept. Teachers worked together to

pool resources so they could create video tutorials for one another. Feller,

the technology integration specialist at Stillwater, noted that when carried out

in isolation, flipping was a lot of work, but when done in a network there was

a pooling of resources and more importantly a pooling of wisdom (Finkel,

2012).

includes beginning gradually, collaborating with colleagues to increase capacity

and speed of implementation, utilising freely available resources on the Internet,

and adapting current materials. These suggestions will allow the reader to begin

the process of flipping instruction efficiently.

Conclusion

There has been an increase in the variety of methodology used to engage students

in the learning process worldwide. While limited research has been conducted

regarding students with learning difficulties in inclusive settings using a flipped

learning model, initial research indicates that flipping a classroom can be benefi-

cial. Studies of student perception indicate that the flipped classroom is more

advantageous than the teacher-centred approach of the conventional method of

teaching. Flipping the classroom assists teachers in differentiating instruction to

meet the needs of learners with learning difficulties. Self-pacing, mastery learning

provides students with choices in how they prefer to learn content. The teacher

essentially transfers the responsibility for learning to the students. The flipped

classroom provides for increased co-operation and co-operative learning. Students

help each other learn instead of relying on the teacher as the exclusive dissemina-

tor of knowledge. The flipped classroom also allows for immediate and regular

formative feedback.

Tucker (2012a) has stated that it seems almost certain that instructional videos,

interactive simulations and yet-to-be-dreamed-up online tools will continue to

multiply. The continued use of technology is changing the face of instruction not

only at the primary and secondary level, but in higher education as well. Utilising

technology to invert instruction so that direct instruction occurs outside the class-

room is improving instruction inside the classroom, and can be beneficial to

learners in inclusive settings.
