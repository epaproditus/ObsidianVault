1. **Definition**:
    
    - **Curriculum Goals**: These are broad purposes or ends stated in general terms without specific criteria for achievement. They express what educational planners aspire for students to accomplish, reflecting overarching educational aims.
    - **Curriculum Objectives**: These are specific, measurable ends that derive from the broader curriculum goals. Objectives are detailed statements that outline what students are expected to achieve as a result of a particular educational program.
2. **Specificity**:
    
    - Goals are more general and can apply broadly across educational contexts. For example, a goal might state, "Students will demonstrate responsible behavior."
    - Objectives specify particular outcomes, often including quantifiable criteria. For instance, an objective might specify, "One hundred percent of the students will volunteer for community service."
3. **Measurement**:
    
    - Curriculum goals do not include criteria for measuring success. They are aspirational statements that set directions for educational programming.
    - Curriculum objectives include criteria for achievement, allowing for evaluation of studentsâ€™ performance and learning. They typically outline the degree of mastery expected and the conditions under which students will demonstrate their knowledge or skills.
4. **Examples**:
    
    - As an illustration, a curriculum goal could be "Students will develop an appreciation for cultural diversity," while corresponding objectives would include measurable tasks like "Ninety percent of students will participate in a cultural fair."

In summary, curriculum goals articulate broad educational intents while curriculum objectives specify detailed, measurable outcomes that are derived from those broader goals, providing a clearer pathway for assessment and achievement in educational contexts.
