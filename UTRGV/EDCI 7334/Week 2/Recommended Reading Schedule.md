1. **<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Curriculum Goals, Objectives, and Products (Oliva):</mark>**** This reading outlines the distinctions between goals and objectives in curriculum development, emphasizing the importance of clear definitions to guide effective teaching and learning.

2. **George S. Counts - Dare Progressive Education Be Progressive?**: Counts critiques the Progressive Education movement, suggesting that merely focusing on the child and their interests is insufficient as it lacks a comprehensive social theory. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">This complements Oliva's work by questioning the foundation upon which curricular goals should be built in relation to societal needs.</mark>

3. **John Dewey - The Child and the Curriculum**: Dewey emphasizes the role of the child in education and advocates for a curriculum that is responsive to the needs and experiences of learners. It reinforces the ideas in Oliva’s text about curriculum objectives being aligned with the skills and needs of students.

4. **Paulo Freire - Pedagogy of the Oppressed (Chapter 2)**: Freire argues against the "banking" concept of education, advocating for a problem-posing model that emphasizes critical consciousness and dialogue. This challenges traditional methodologies of curriculum development discussed in Oliva’s text, suggesting a move towards a more interactive and liberating approach to education.

### Suggested Reading Schedule:

**Day 1**:
- **Morning**: Read **"Curriculum Goals, Objectives, and Products" (Oliva)** - Focus on the definitions and distinction between goals and objectives. Take notes on the hierarchy of outcomes.
- **Afternoon**: Read **"Dare Progressive Education Be Progressive?" (Counts)** - Analyze Counts' critiques regarding the limitations of progressive education and its implications for curriculum theory.

**Day 2**:
- **Morning**: Read **"The Child and the Curriculum" (Dewey)** - Reflect on Dewey’s perspective about integrating child experiences into curriculum design. Consider how it connects to the previous texts.
- **Afternoon**: Read **"Pedagogy of the Oppressed (Chapter 2)" (Freire)** - Pay attention to Freire’s analysis of the teacher-student relationship and the call for critical pedagogy.

**Day 3**:
- Review the notes from each reading, focusing on how each author’s arguments connect. Reflect on how Counts, Dewey, and Freire either support or critique Oliva’s framework for curriculum development.
  
**Day 4**:
- Write a synthesis of the key themes from all four readings, highlighting how they collectively inform your understanding of education theory. Consider preparing potential questions or points of discussion for your class.

This schedule allows you to engage deeply with each text while giving you sufficient time to reflect and synthesize the information before class discussions. Enjoy your readings!
