**Abstract**

This paper addresses the pressing need for effective implementation of High-Quality Instructional Materials (HQIM) in response to persistent underperformance in mathematics among 7th and 8th-grade students at Carlos F. Truan Middle School. Despite the adoption of HQIM, data indicates that students are not achieving the mastery expected. To remedy this, the flipped classroom model is proposed as a relevant pedagogical approach that aligns with constructivist principles, facilitating active learning and deeper engagement with mathematical concepts. The primary aim of this project is to enhance mathematical proficiency and student engagement through the implementation of the flipped classroom model, ultimately improving performance on the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) in Mathematics. The project will deliver high-quality instructional videos and transform in-class time into an active learning environment, with regular formative assessments integrated to measure student progress and inform instructional practices. This work is significant for educators, administrators, and policymakers seeking to improve student outcomes in mathematics through innovative instructional strategies, ultimately fostering a more equitable learning environment for all students.**Background**

The persistent underperformance of 7th and 8th-grade students in mathematics at Carlos F. Truan Middle School has raised significant concerns among educators and stakeholders. Analysis of STAAR assessment data from 2013 to 2024 reveals a troubling trend: a consistently low percentage of students in these grades have achieved the "Approaches" performance level on mathematics assessments. This underachievement is particularly alarming given the district's commitment to implementing High-Quality Instructional Materials (HQIM) across all grade levels in collaboration with Instruction Partners. While the adoption of HQIM holds promise for enhancing student outcomes, the ongoing struggles in mathematics at Carlos F. Truan suggest that factors beyond the quality of materials and external support may be contributing to this issue.

The need for reevaluation of HQIM implementation is underscored by data indicating that it is not delivering the mastery it promises. During my involvement in an HQIM pilot program over the past four years, I have witnessed firsthand the challenges faced by teachers in effectively utilizing these materials. As the individual responsible for overseeing the implementation, I have encountered significant barriers that hinder the successful integration of HQIM into classroom instruction. These challenges include insufficient professional development, lack of ongoing support, and the need for a more robust instructional framework that aligns with the diverse learning needs of students.

Research supports the notion that simply providing teachers with HQIM does not guarantee improved student outcomes. For instance, Blazar et al. (2019) found that teachers often struggle to implement new materials with fidelity, highlighting the necessity for comprehensive professional development and supportive school environments. The experience at Carlos F. Truan Middle School aligns with these findings, emphasizing the importance of examining not only the quality of HQIM and professional development but also the broader instructional context in which these materials are utilized.

The social, historical, and cultural contexts surrounding Carlos F. Truan Middle School further complicate the educational landscape. The school serves a diverse student population, with many students coming from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. This demographic reality necessitates a tailored approach to instruction that considers the unique challenges faced by these students. Additionally, historical patterns of underachievement in mathematics within the district have created a sense of urgency among educators to implement effective strategies that can lead to meaningful improvements in student performance.

This project is designed to positively impact the learning community at Carlos F. Truan Middle School, particularly the teachers implementing HQIM. The initiative aims to extend beyond the junior high school level, reaching high school and elementary school educators, ultimately benefiting students across all grade levels. By addressing the identified community need through the implementation of the flipped classroom model, this project seeks to create a more engaging, effective, and equitable learning environment that supports the development of mathematical understanding among all students.

In conclusion, the challenges faced by Carlos F. Truan Middle School in mathematics education highlight the urgent need for innovative instructional strategies. The flipped classroom model presents a promising solution to enhance the effectiveness of HQIM implementation, fostering deeper engagement and improved outcomes for students. By reevaluating our approach to curriculum and instruction, we can work towards achieving the mastery in mathematics that our students deserve.

**Theoretical Rationale**

The persistent underachievement in mathematics at Carlos F. Truan Middle School necessitates a critical examination of current instructional practices and the exploration of innovative approaches to teaching and learning. As noted in the background section, while the adoption of high-quality instructional materials (HQIM) holds promise, its implementation has encountered significant barriers, leading to a need for a more robust instructional framework that caters to the diverse learning needs of students. The flipped classroom model emerges as a compelling pedagogical approach that aligns with constructivist learning theory, promoting active learning, student engagement, and a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts. This rationale will examine the theoretical underpinnings of the flipped classroom model, drawing upon research and relevant literature to support its potential to address the identified community need at Carlos F. Truan Middle School.

At its core, the flipped classroom model inverts the traditional model of instruction, moving direct instruction, typically delivered through lectures, to the individual learning space outside of class, freeing up class time for active learning and the application of knowledge. This shift in pedagogy aligns with the principles of constructivist learning theory, which posits that learners actively construct knowledge through their interactions with the environment and their peers. The flipped classroom model leverages technology to facilitate this process, providing students access to instructional videos, online resources, and interactive tools that allow them to learn at their own pace and revisit concepts as needed. This self-paced learning environment is particularly beneficial for students struggling with mathematics, as it allows them to solidify their understanding of foundational concepts before moving on to more challenging material.

Furthermore, the flipped classroom model fosters a more student-centered learning environment that encourages inquiry-based learning. By shifting the focus from the passive reception of information to active application and analysis, students are empowered to take ownership of their learning, explore mathematical concepts in greater depth, and develop critical thinking skills. For example, instead of spending class time watching a teacher solve problems, students can work collaboratively to solve problems, discuss their reasoning, and make connections between different concepts. This approach aligns with the principles of Understanding by Design (UBD), which emphasizes the importance of backward design, beginning with the desired learning outcomes and then planning learning experiences that support the development of those outcomes. By utilizing the flipped classroom model, teachers can create opportunities for "real-life disciplinary tasks or performances" that allow students to apply their knowledge in meaningful contexts, fostering deeper understanding and promoting higher-level thinking skills.

Moreover, the flipped classroom model provides a platform for differentiated instruction, enabling teachers to tailor their instruction to the diverse learning needs of students. This approach recognizes that students learn at different paces and have varying levels of prior knowledge, requiring personalized support and adjustments in the learning process. In a flipped classroom, teachers have more time to work individually with students, provide targeted feedback, and create opportunities for reassessment, enabling them to effectively address individual learning gaps and ensure that all students have the opportunity to succeed. This emphasis on personalized learning aligns with the goals of HQIM, which seek to provide high-quality, standards-aligned materials that support the needs of all learners.

One of the key strengths of the flipped classroom model lies in its potential to facilitate mastery learning. This pedagogical approach emphasizes the importance of students demonstrating proficiency in a concept before moving on to the next, ensuring that they build a solid foundation in mathematics and do not fall behind due to gaps in their understanding. In a flipped classroom, the availability of instructional videos and online resources allows students to revisit concepts as needed, providing ample opportunities for practice and reinforcement. Additionally, the increased class time dedicated to active learning allows teachers to closely monitor student progress, provide immediate feedback, and offer individualized support, making mastery learning more feasible and effective.

Research has consistently shown that the flipped classroom model can increase student engagement and motivation. By providing a more active and interactive learning experience, the flipped classroom can make mathematics more enjoyable and relevant for students, leading to improved academic performance and a more positive attitude toward learning. One student remarked, "Finally, somebody who teaches the way I learn." This shift in student perception aligns with the findings of Bhagat et al. (2016), who concluded that "the flipped classroom was better than the teacher-centered approach in the conventional method of teaching" and that it particularly benefited lower-achieving students.

By embracing the flipped classroom model, Carlos F. Truan Middle School can create a more engaging, effective, and equitable learning environment that supports the development of mathematical understanding among all students. This shift in pedagogy, grounded in constructivist learning theory and supported by research evidence, offers a promising solution to the challenges facing mathematics education at the school. Through the implementation of the flipped classroom model, teachers can leverage the benefits of differentiated instruction, mastery learning, and increased student engagement, ultimately fostering a culture of academic success and empowering all students to reach their full potential in mathematics.

**Project Goals, Objectives, and Assessment Metrics**

The success of the project to implement the flipped classroom model at Carlos F. Truan Middle School will be measured through clearly defined goals and objectives, accompanied by specific assessment metrics. These metrics will provide a framework for evaluating the effectiveness of the initiative in enhancing student learning outcomes in mathematics.

The primary goal of this project is to improve the mathematical proficiency of 7th and 8th-grade students. To achieve this goal, the project will focus on several key objectives. First, the development of high-quality instructional videos will be prioritized, ensuring that these resources align with the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS). The effectiveness of these videos will be assessed through student engagement metrics, such as the number of views and completion rates, as well as through feedback collected via surveys that gauge student understanding and satisfaction with the content.

Another objective is to implement regular formative assessments that monitor student progress throughout the academic year. These assessments will include quizzes, exit tickets, and in-class activities designed to evaluate students' understanding of mathematical concepts. The results of these assessments will be analyzed to identify trends in student performance, allowing for timely interventions and adjustments to instruction as needed.

In addition to student performance metrics, the project will also focus on fostering a collaborative and active learning environment. To assess this objective, classroom observations will be conducted to evaluate the level of student engagement during in-class activities. Teachers will be provided with observation checklists to document student participation, collaboration, and problem-solving skills demonstrated during group work. This qualitative data will complement the quantitative assessment metrics, providing a comprehensive view of the learning environment.

Furthermore, the project aims to support teachers in effectively implementing the flipped classroom model. Professional development workshops will be evaluated through participant feedback and pre- and post-workshop surveys that measure teachers' confidence and competence in using the flipped classroom approach. Additionally, follow-up observations will be conducted to assess the fidelity of implementation in the classroom, ensuring that teachers are utilizing the resources and strategies discussed during the training.

Ultimately, the overarching assessment metric for the project will be the improvement in student performance on the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) in Mathematics. By comparing STAAR scores from previous years to those achieved after the implementation of the flipped classroom model, the project will be able to determine its impact on student learning outcomes. A target of a 10% increase in the percentage of students achieving the "Approaches" performance level will be set as a benchmark for success.

  

Through these clearly defined goals, objectives, and assessment metrics, the project aims to create a robust framework for evaluating the effectiveness of the flipped classroom model in enhancing mathematical proficiency among students at Carlos F. Truan Middle School. By continuously monitoring progress and making data-informed decisions, the initiative seeks to foster a culture of academic success and empower all students to reach their full potential in mathematics.
