Abstract

This paper addresses the pressing need for effective implementation of High-Quality Instructional Materials (HQIM) in response to persistent underperformance in mathematics among 7th and 8th-grade students at Carlos F. Truan Middle School. Despite the adoption of HQIM, data indicates that students are not achieving the mastery expected. To remedy this, the flipped classroom model is proposed as a relevant pedagogical approach that aligns with constructivist principles, facilitating active learning and deeper engagement with mathematical concepts. The primary aim of this project is to enhance mathematical proficiency and student engagement through the implementation of the flipped classroom model, ultimately improving performance on the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) in Mathematics. The project will deliver high-quality instructional videos and transform in-class time into an active learning environment, with regular formative assessments integrated to measure student progress and inform instructional practices. This work is significant for educators, administrators, and policymakers seeking to improve student outcomes in mathematics through innovative instructional strategies, ultimately fostering a more equitable learning environment for all students.

  The persistent underperformance of 7th and 8th-grade students in mathematics at Carlos F. Truan Middle School has raised significant concerns among educators and stakeholders. Analysis of STAAR assessment data from 2013 to 2024 reveals a troubling trend: a consistently low percentage of students in these grades have achieved the "Approaches" performance level on mathematics assessments. This underachievement is particularly alarming given the district's commitment to implementing High-Quality Instructional Materials (HQIM) across all grade levels in collaboration with Instruction Partners. While the adoption of HQIM holds promise for enhancing student outcomes, the ongoing struggles in mathematics at Carlos F. Truan suggest that factors beyond the quality of materials and external support may be contributing to this issue.

The need for reevaluation of HQIM implementation is underscored by data indicating that it is not delivering the mastery it promises. During my involvement in an HQIM pilot program over the past four years, I have witnessed firsthand the challenges faced by teachers in effectively utilizing these materials. As the individual responsible for overseeing the implementation, I have encountered significant barriers that hinder the successful integration of HQIM into classroom instruction. These challenges include insufficient professional development, lack of ongoing support, and the need for a more robust instructional framework that aligns with the diverse learning needs of students.

Research supports the notion that simply providing teachers with HQIM does not guarantee improved student outcomes. For instance, Blazar et al. (2019) found that teachers often struggle to implement new materials with fidelity, highlighting the necessity for comprehensive professional development and supportive school environments. The experience at Carlos F. Truan Middle School aligns with these findings, emphasizing the importance of examining not only the quality of HQIM and professional development but also the broader instructional context in which these materials are utilized.

The social, historical, and cultural contexts surrounding Carlos F. Truan Middle School further complicate the educational landscape. The school serves a diverse student population, with many students coming from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. This demographic reality necessitates a tailored approach to instruction that considers the unique challenges faced by these students. Additionally, historical patterns of underachievement in mathematics within the district have created a sense of urgency among educators to implement effective strategies that can lead to meaningful improvements in student performance.

This project is designed to positively impact the learning community at Carlos F. Truan Middle School, particularly the teachers implementing HQIM. The initiative aims to extend beyond the junior high school level, reaching high school and elementary school educators, ultimately benefiting students across all grade levels. By addressing the identified community need through the implementation of the flipped classroom model, this project seeks to create a more engaging, effective, and equitable learning environment that supports the development of mathematical understanding among all students.

In conclusion, the challenges faced by Carlos F. Truan Middle School in mathematics education highlight the urgent need for innovative instructional strategies. The flipped classroom model presents a promising solution to enhance the effectiveness of HQIM implementation, fostering deeper engagement and improved outcomes for students. By reevaluating our approach to curriculum and instruction, we can work towards achieving the mastery in mathematics that our students deserve.
