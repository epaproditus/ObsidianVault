**Definition of CPP:**  
CPP is described as "curriculum and pedagogy as a practical action" that merges curriculum content with pedagogy in teaching and learning. Furthermore, "praxis" is characterized as the active, ongoing process of "thinking, doing, and theorizing" educators engage in during teaching. The term "curricular-pedagogical" refers to the integration of content, instruction, and theory in practice.

**Historical Languages of CPP:**

**Overlay of Human Science Shifts:**  
The document also notes the broader implications of these languages beyond CPP, mentioning the bureaucratic and critical theories that emerged in response to challenges of population management and control, emphasizing "human emancipation" over administrative control.

In summary, as articulated in the document, "CPP are languages of theory-practice or praxis" with each of the four historical languages contributing to an ongoing dialogue about educational practice, theory, and social context. Critical CPP remains an important area of exploration, seeking alternatives to traditional curriculum management and control mechanisms.
