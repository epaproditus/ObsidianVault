### Document Summary: 

**Overview**
Stephen J. Sniegoski's document explores the contributions of William Torrey Harris to American education during the 19th century, emphasizing his philosophical justifications for a robust academic curriculum amidst contemporary challenges in education. 

**Paragraph 1 Summary**
The first paragraph introduces the prevailing issue of declining academic achievement among students and asserts the relevance of Harris's educational philosophy. Sniegoski highlights that Harris was a reformer who aimed at fostering reason through education. He notes, “the purpose of school was to foster the development of reason,” outlining Harris’s role in curriculum development such as modern subjects' inclusion in high school.

**Paragraph 2 Summary**
Sniegoski details Harris's background, including his dissatisfaction with Yale's curriculum and his rise as St. Louis superintendent. Harris implemented reforms like public kindergarten and was noted for his extensive writings. “Yale focused on the classical languages... Harris sought broader learning,” showcasing his desire for an improved education system.

**Paragraph 3 Summary**
Harris's involvement with the National Education Association (NEA) is examined here. He became influential within the organization and significantly shaped two critical committees. “He used to control the decisions of the Association year after year,” emphasizing his authority over educational reforms.

**Paragraph 4 Summary**
The document outlines Harris's philosophical evolution, influenced by German idealism, particularly Hegel. He established a philosophical basis for education which he believed was essential for rational freedom. His belief was that “only a rational being... could be truly free,” emphasizing the role of education in achieving this liberation.

**Paragraph 5 Summary**
Sniegoski underscores the societal role of education according to Harris, distinguishing it from familial training which he viewed as unconscious and prejudicial. Harris insisted that schooling should develop rational understanding, stating, “It lays all its stress on producing a consciousness of the grounds and reasons for things.”

**Paragraph 6 Summary**
Harris believed that the curriculum should connect children to their cultural heritage. He identified "the five windows of the soul" as key subjects: mathematics, geography, history, grammar, and literature, claiming they foster a comprehensive understanding of one's society. He argued that understanding these subjects promotes an understanding of self, stating, “the scholar learns his presuppositions... he begins to be somebody in real earnest.”

**Paragraph 7 Summary**
Here, Sniegoski delineates Harris's views on intellectual rigor and educational progression. He asserts that mastering foundational knowledge in elementary school is crucial before advancing to higher concepts. Harris warned against early insights leading to “self-conceited” knowledge that disregards authority.

**Paragraph 8 Summary**
This section contrasts Harris's curriculum ideas with the limited focus of earlier education on the "3 R's" and emphasizes the change brought by modern subjects. Harris critiqued the idea of mental discipline behind the classics, advocating for the understanding of Western civilization's content.

**Paragraph 9 Summary**
Sniegoski discusses criticisms of separate subjects in education, which Harris countered by claiming each discipline offered unique insights. He also opposed efforts to make education overly practical or vocational, stating, “Harris simply believed that these forms of education should be primarily the concern of institutions other than the school.”

**Paragraph 10 Summary**
The document notes Harris's belief in the importance of classical studies like Latin and Greek for understanding Western civilization. He asserted that studying these subjects was vital, explaining, “We must don the garb in which they thought and spoke, in order to realize...these embryonic states of our civilization.”

**Paragraph 11 Summary**
Sniegoski reflects on the rise of “child-centered” education, which Harris contended was misguided since children needed to learn societal values and norms. Harris stated, “The child begins life a savage, ignorant of education,” arguing for a structured and disciplined educational approach.

**Paragraph 12 Summary**
In his later years, Harris criticized educational reforms that dismissed traditional curricula. He acknowledged some beneficial innovations but cautioned against neglecting the wisdom of past educational practices, believing it led to a “zigzag” progression in education.

**Paragraph 13 Summary**
Despite Harris's opposition, progressive reforms became dominant in the 20th century. Sniegoski highlights current concerns over academic decline, suggesting that Harris's ideas on enriching academic rigor remain relevant. He concludes with a contemporary perspective, noting, “The function for which the school is uniquely responsible is the development of the child's mind.” 

This comprehensive overview underscores Harris's pivotal role in shaping educational philosophy and his enduring influence on contemporary discussions surrounding academic rigor.

### LLM Analysis###
William Torrey Harris, as discussed in Stephen J. Sniegoski's document "William Torrey Harris and the Academic School," primarily supports the **Intellectual Traditionalist** language of Curricular-Pedagogical Praxis (CPP). Here’s how the paper aligns with this language:

#### Support for Intellectual Traditionalist Language:
1. **Emphasis on Classical Studies**: Harris advocates for the inclusion of classical subjects such as Latin and Greek in the curriculum, asserting their importance for understanding Western civilization. This focus on traditional academic subjects is characteristic of the Intellectual Traditionalist approach.

2. **Rigor and Structure in Education**: Harris believes in the necessity of a structured and disciplined educational approach, emphasizing the mastery of foundational knowledge before advancing to higher concepts. This reflects the Intellectual Traditionalist view that values a rigorous academic curriculum.

3. **Cultural Heritage**: He argues that education should connect children to their cultural heritage through subjects like mathematics, geography, history, grammar, and literature. This aligns with the Intellectual Traditionalist perspective that emphasizes the importance of a well-rounded, content-rich curriculum.

4. **Critique of Progressive Education**: Harris criticizes the shift towards child-centered education and overly practical or vocational training, arguing that such approaches neglect the development of rational understanding and societal values. This critique supports the Intellectual Traditionalist stance that prioritizes academic rigor over more progressive, experiential learning methods.

#### Rejection of Other Languages:
- **Positivist**: While Harris values empirical knowledge, his emphasis on classical studies and philosophical foundations suggests a rejection of a purely scientific or data-driven approach to curriculum development.

- **Interpretivist Experiential**: Harris's focus on structured learning and societal norms contrasts with the Interpretivist emphasis on individual experiences and subjective understanding.

- **Critical Praxeologist**: Although he acknowledges the societal role of education, his primary focus on traditional academic subjects and structured learning may not fully engage with the Critical Praxeologist perspective, which emphasizes the political and social contexts of education.

In summary, Harris's educational philosophy supports the Intellectual Traditionalist language of CPP by advocating for a rigorous, content-rich curriculum grounded in classical studies and cultural heritage, while rejecting more progressive and experiential approaches to education.
