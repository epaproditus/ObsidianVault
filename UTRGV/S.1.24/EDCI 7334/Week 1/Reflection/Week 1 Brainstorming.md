###### Brainstorm
Researching about the different CPP's was so enlightening especially since my background is not related to education (it's engineering). For one it was helpful to see curriculum as the what and pedagogy as the how. It was also helpful to see that there are four categories. 

I learned from the traditionalists that we should value the common ideals of humanity as presented in the great works. After all, it is what we all have in common. 

From the behaviorist I learned that curriculum should be much more than ideals and should be something that is practical. I appreciated the exapmle that Bobbitt presents in terms of studying the farmers that are the most efficient and replicating their practices. He really cares for the practicality of education. though i do wonder how bobbitt would be about a curriculum that prepares a student for services that do not yet exist, espcially with the explosion of technology such as artificial intelligence. Since it's changing so fast, how do you design curriculum for jobs that do not yet exist but are up and cmoning. If it's so practical, how does curriclum prepare students to think about bigger ideas? 

From the *feel gooders* I learned that students are innately curious about the world around them and should not be restricted to the classroom for learning. 

And from the reformists, I learned that there is a philosophy that seeks to have an equitable society. it was good to see what was referenced as the *hidden curriculum* as the curriculum. I was pushed to see that an equitable learning means that *all* students can learn. 

The dialogue personified in Schubert's writing was as amusing as informative. Having seen the tensions between them. Though the behaviorst see themselves as improving or building upon the traditionalist. The traditionalist doesn't really aprreciate the zeroing on the empriical data that needs to back up the usefulness of what's being taught. 

I also saw the struggle between the fell gooders and the reformists. Though the reformist agrees with much of the feel gooders. The reformist doens't think that they go far enough. 

I was intrigued by the mention that tradiationalist and behaviorst *literally* wipe out the the other two and i'm cursious to learn more about that perspective. 

Overall, I saw the struggle from all the four CPP's to be not just an external one playing out in today's curriculum's throughout school but also internally where I was rooting for the deepness of mathematics (as that is what i teach) but also wondering about the practicality of it (since i studied engineering). I also felt that when my 4 year old learns about the world around him and yearhing to know how rockets work, he is definitely much more engaged than my 14 year old in the classroom. I also empathize with the struggle of the people and saw myself as an accomplice in a system that produces factory workers without meaning to. Yet, not much I can do can help and the most i can do is to provide an equitable learning to all my students and push them to be the best that they can. Letting them know that the student with resources is no better than him without it. yet it's hard. It's a struggle within me. 

Overall I found myself relating to the traditionalist and the quest for the commonality of humankind. I find myself yearning for that better professor who would teach mathematics in such a passionate way that students themselves would find practicality. But my rational being does gravitate towards the vehaviorst. What good is education if you can't do anything with it. What good is to be educated without being of value to society. Isn't that why we got rid of the aristocracy?

I do not find myself gravitating towards the teaching of good feelers and reformists. Perhaps it's too abstract as the panelist questions the personifications that I nust cna't see how that would work. How would you teach students to learn as much as possible so that they can become creators when the system desperately needs the means of production. 

Same with teh gooders, how do you let them roam and learn about things when Tik Tok is grabbing theri attention. What happens when the attention span is so minimal that there is no capacity for wondering? 

I have more quesitons thatn answerss but overall am curious. 

###### Quotes
>1. **Adler's Great Ideas**: "Adler, for instance, writes of six great ideas: truth, beauty, goodness, liberty, equality, and justice. These ideas transcend matters of culture, race, gender, class, age, ethnicity, location, health or ableness, national origin, and any other aspects of individual and social life that too many consider reasons for gaining separate or individualized treatment."
>2. "This focus on individual differences neglects what all human beings have in commonâ€”in fact, it omits what makes them essentially human, namely, the great ideas. Every human who has ever lived is concerned about these matters in his or her own life and in the social context of that life."
>3. "We need teachers who deeply appreciate the liberal arts traditions. Almost half a century ago, liberal arts advocate Gilbert Highet wrote of the art of teaching and said that to be a great teacher one must know and love one's subject. Too many teachers do not know or appreciate the depth and breadth of their subject, so how can we expect them to inspire others to immerse themselves in it?"
>4. "First you have to have better teachers, not ones raised on the vapidity of textbooks, ones who can only teach through reliance on textbooks. We need teachers who deeply appreciate the liberal arts tradition"
>5. we need teachers who make the subject they teach come alive. 

Social Behaviorist Criticism:
"How do we design a curriculum that provides an avenue to reach students through these great works, and how do we know if modern works are worthy of being part of a great works or great ideas curriculum? Also, how do we convince parents and policymakers that this curriculum will help students get jobs and live well?"
Response
"Getting jobs should be a task of the economy at large, not of the schools alone. Education should not be primarily vocational. However, the kind of curriculum I advocate teaches students to be interested in the great questions that penetrate all aspects of understanding the world. A great works curriculum enables students to think more carefully and to appreciate more deeply. This is needed in all jobs."
