**user**: Ask me questions that will serve the ultimate purpose of answering the Reflection questions on [[Project Objectives]]. Do not answer the questions for me as the ideas must be my original thoughts but guide me through a process that can help me answer them.

**ai**: To help you reflect on the questions related to [[Project Objectives]], let's break down each reflection question and explore some guiding questions that can lead you to your original thoughts. 

### Reflection Question 1: How was it different from the assessments you usually use?
1. **Consider your typical assessments**: What types of assessments do you usually implement in your classroom? Are they primarily formative, summative, or a mix of both?
2. **Identify specific characteristics**: What are the key features of those assessments? For example, do they focus more on memorization, problem-solving, or application of concepts?
3. **Contrast with Project 1**: In what ways do the assessments in Project 1 differ from your usual assessments? Think about the format, the type of tasks, and the learning objectives.
4. **Impact on students**: How do you think these differences will affect student engagement and understanding?

### Reflection Question 2: How did it challenge your preconceptions of what an assessment should be?
1. **Reflect on your beliefs**: What are your beliefs about assessments? What do you think makes an assessment effective?
2. **Identify challenges**: Did any aspects of Project 1 make you reconsider those beliefs? For example, did the use of games or authentic tasks challenge your view of traditional assessments?
3. **Consider student perspectives**: How do you think students might perceive these new types of assessments compared to traditional ones?
4. **Future implications**: How might this experience influence your approach to assessments in the future?

### Reflection Question 3: How difficult was it for you to create this balanced plan and why?
1. **Assess your experience**: What was your initial reaction when you started creating the balanced assessment plan? Did you find it straightforward or challenging?
2. **Identify specific challenges**: What specific aspects of creating this plan did you find most difficult? Was it balancing formative and summative assessments, aligning with learning objectives, or something else?
3. **Support and resources**: Did you have the necessary resources or support to create this plan? How did that impact your experience?
4. **Personal growth**: What did you learn about your own teaching practices through this process? How might this experience shape your future planning?

Take your time to think through these guiding questions, and jot down your thoughts. This process should help you articulate your reflections on the assessments in Project 1.
