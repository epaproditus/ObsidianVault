Writing learning objectives for 8th grade math can be structured around the three purposes of assessment: Assessment for Learning, Assessment as Learning, and Assessment of Learning. Here are examples of how to frame learning objectives for each purpose:

### Assessment for Learning (Formative Assessment)
**Objective:** Students will demonstrate proficiency in solving linear equations by accurately solving at least 5 equations during a class activity. 
- **Explanation:** This objective emphasizes what learners will do during the instruction. It allows the teacher to assess whether the teaching strategies are effective and to make adjustments based on real-time feedback.

### Assessment as Learning (Self-Assessment and Reflection)
**Objective:** Students will reflect on their problem-solving strategies used in completing a math project and identify at least two areas where they excelled and two areas for improvement.
- **Explanation:** This objective encourages students to engage in metacognition by considering their learning processes. It fosters ownership of their learning and promotes self-assessment as they evaluate their understanding and skills. 

### Assessment of Learning (Summative Assessment)
**Objective:** Students will achieve a score of 80% or higher on the unit test covering geometric transformations, demonstrating their ability to apply knowledge of translations, rotations, and reflections to solve problems.
- **Explanation:** This objective is designed for summative assessment, where the focus is on evaluating students' understanding and knowledge retention at the end of an instructional period. It provides clear criteria for success and helps determine final competency in the subject matter.

Each of these objectives corresponds to different stages of the learning process and indicates how assessment can support and enhance student learning effectively.
