| Assessment for Learning | The learner will remember graph the solution of an inequality with one variable on a number line as seen in the Module 3 Topic 2 Lesson 4        | This is a formative assessment that will support the broader topic of solving inequalities with two variables.                     | The assessment is an introduction that provides for a strong foundation before discovering new information.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Assessment as Learning  | The learner will explain why an inequality contains a set of solution instead of just one solution as demonstrated in an Exit Ticket             | This is a formative assessment that supports student thinking to demonstrate their understanding of solution sets to inequalities. | The assessment is for self-assessment. Students should understand that an inequality is not limited to one solution and thus every solution is part of a set of solutions. This is fundamental to understanding how to graph a half-plane of solutions to inequalities. |
| Assessment of Learning  | The learner will evaluate the solution set of linear inequalities two variables on the coordinate plane as demonstrated by a game of battleship. | This is a summative assessment that will be at the end of the lesson. The authentic task is not a traditional one.                 | The assessment will assess for their learning based on their performance.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Reflection
- How was it different from the assessments you usually use?
	- The requirement for the Assessment of Learning to focus on an "authentic task" is unfamiliar to me. I typically rely on traditional assessment methods, such as end-of-topic evaluations. 
	- While I often consider how students will ultimately demonstrate proficiency in an Assessment of Learning, I do not formally integrate this into my planning. My usual thought process is, "How will this be assessed on the STAAR test?" Moreover, it is not a primary consideration in my current planning process, as the existing curriculum largely dictates lesson objectives, and any deviation is discouraged.

- How did it challenge your preconceptions of what an assessment should be?
	- I am genuinely intrigued by the concept of "authentic tasks" and how we might integrate them into the assessment of learning. I frequently conducTo help you reflect on the questions related to [[Project Objectives]], let's break down each reflection question and explore some guiding questions that can lead you to your original thoughts. 

- How difficult was it for you to create this balanced plan and why?
	- I found the balanced plan relatively easy to create. Utilizing Carnegie Learning, which offers substantial support for educators, coupled with two years of third-party assistance, has made me accustomed to this planning approach, even if I haven't formalized it to the extent described here.


# Feedback
Excellent description of learning objectives, assessment, and justification.

Reflection was critical and thoughtful. 

Glad you used Obsidian for this work.
