This review guides you through analyzing quantitative data from summative assessments, focusing on the assessment objectives and implications for future instruction.

## Course Level Objective (CLO 6)

The in-service educator will determine how to use digital tools to record and analyze summative assessment data, assessing student achievement and informing future instruction.

## Module Level Objective (MLO 6.1)

In-service educators will review data collection and analysis of quantitative summative data gathered from digital tools in a SoftChalk Interactive Review.

## How This Review Works

The review consists of multiple readings related to this week's theme, enabling you to accumulate points through interactive activities that can be revisited, with guidance on browser usage and tracking your score.

# First Topic

## Stage 4: Data Collection

The first topic this week is to review stage four of the assessment cycle: data collection. While you have already collected data from formative assessments, this data collection is the last, summative one. In this step, you will implement your summative assessment, previously planned. Teachers often think that implementing a summative assessment is just about giving students an assignment and grading it. However, this step can yield as much rich data as the formative assessments.

In your previous readings on assessment of learning, you learned that these types of assessments show student achievement. Achievement, however, can be shown in different ways. Review the image below for additional information on how students can show various degrees of mastery of a learning objective. [^1]
### Cycle

### Qualitative Summative Data
How will the implementation of the summative assessment represent qualitative data?

All assessments are an opportunity for qualitative assessment. This question refers to the behavior of the students and what you find out about hidden talents that would not be visible with a simple multiple choice or traditional test.

### Quantitative Summative Data
How will the implementation of the summative assessment represent quantitative data?

Quantitative data is a natural part of a summative assessment because it yields grades or rating scores. In authentic assessments graded by a rubric, quantitative scores divide the performance in different criteria.

### Summative Achievement
How can data be gathered from a summative assessment so that it demonstrates achievement in the objective?

All assessments should be aligned to the objective, and data should demonstrate if students successfully learned the objective. This is typically demonstrated very simply by the teacher's expection of how a grade shows the appropriate degree of mastery.

# Second Topic

## Revisiting Summative Assessments
In a previous module, you planned your PBL[^2] summative assessment, which is authentic and real-world connected. You also created a rubric that can evaluate the results of the implementation. In other words, the rubric is your grading tool. You reviewed how the grading tool can help you answer the three questions posed in stage four of the classroom assessment cycle.

This brief revisit of the summative assessment is to indicate how you gather qualitative data from that implementation event when you only have a rubric setup. However, consider that an assessment this is more than just multiple-choice items has more information to give you than just a summative grade. Ask yourself the following questions:

- What did I learn about how my students approach a large project?
- What strengths did I notice in my students that have nothing to do with the grade you gave them?
- What failures were opportunities to learn?

Watching your students put together something big is a great opportunity to see learning in action, to think about the process, rather than just the final grade. When you grade your students with your rubric, you should also take the opportunity to write feedback based on the process of completing the summative assessment. The questions posed above are just some ways you can approach feedback. Keep in mind that feedback isn't always on the criteria in the rubric. It is the extra observations you can offer them that are not already on the rubric.

These qualitative data can be gathered at the same time as your quantitative score. Make sure you take the time to do that.

_*Please note that analyzing qualitative feedback is done the same way as described in the previous review activities for analyzing text descriptions. Refer back to that information to review it._

## Stage 5: Analyze Assessment Data

In this topic, stage 5 of the classroom assessment cycle describes key considerations for analyzing summative assessment data. Please note that this review of the stage describes what should be considered, but it does not yet show you how to analyze data. The next topic will go over that.

### Analysis for Student Achievement
What data can be analyzed to test how will students demonstrate achievement of objectives?

Data to demonstrate achievement is usually one summative score or grade. If the learning objective were asked in the form of a significant question, you can determine what the cut off score is for success and graph those that met that score vs those that didn't.

### Analysis of Qualitative[^3] Assessment Data
How will qualitative assessment data be analyzed?
Qualitative assessment data from summative data can be analyzed in much the same way as formative data were for text descriptions or checklists or rubrics. In summative assessments, analyzed data now becomes presentational by creating a visual like a graph to summarize it.

### Analysis of Quantitative[^4] Assessment Data
How will quantitative assessment data be analyzed?

Quantitative assessment data analysis results may be setup in data graphs or charts with the use of Excel spreadsheets.

### Formative and Summative Analysis
What role does formative assessment data play in summative analysis?

Although formative data played its own role in adjusting instruction, when put side by side with summative data, it can offer a perspective on how students get from one learning point to another, like a continuum.

# Fourth Topic

## Analyzing and Transforming Quantitative Data
Quantitative data analysis involves more than just a summative grade when it comes to analysis. For your PBL summative assessment, you will setup rubric data by criteria and proficiency levels for each of your students. This will also involve the use of an Excel spreadsheet and several tabbed sheets within it.

In the slideshow activity below, you will review how to setup and analyze quantitative data using Excel. Keep in mind that these steps involve the setup of data and analysis, but it does not show you how to use Excel. If you have never used Excel and even formulas like sum are beyond your knowledge, there are numerous tutorials online that can walk you through using your version of Excel. Google "how to ___ in Excel" and you will find useful resources to get you what you need.

1 - Collected Data Setup

Because your data were collected from a grading rubric, your data will be setup using the criteria from the PBL summative assessment, and the proficiency levels you used to rate their performance. 

In this case, you will create tabbed sheets for each of the criteria you have in your rubric.  In this example, the rubric has four criteria (as seen in the tabs at the bottom), and this image is the first criteria, "Rigor".  The setup of columns is the names of students and then the proficiency levels your rubric had.
