# Introduction and Purpose

By now, you should have conducted the summative assessment in your classroom, which involves collecting and analyzing data. This data analysis is quantitative and reflects the students' level of achievement.

## Deciphering the Rest of the Story: Your Purpose in this Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze quantitative data from a summative assessment that was implemented in the classroom or which will be simulated. In the absence of a classroom, you will develop the data yourself.

The data used will be quantitative to demonstrate stages 4 and 5 of the classroom assessment cycle. Data are required.

# What You Will Demonstrate in Your Analysis

Data analysis requires order and structure, which is why in your summative assessment plan project, you designed a ==rubric[^1]== with specific criteria that break down a student's achievement in the PBL. The tool determines the order and structure of your data.

While you may have collected the data in Word documents--or simple paper and pencil--your analysis does not occur in Word. It occurs in a spreadsheet. For this, you will use Excel.

Please make note that this project will be comprised of several files uploaded, using both Excel and Word. Different types of data require different setups in a different document, and you will also make a distinction between raw data (unanalyzed, just collected) and analyzed data.

Please make note that this project will be comprised of several files uploaded, using both Excel and Word, as outlined below:

1. [[Student Profiles]]
2. Grading Rubric for Summative Assessment
3. Excel Spreadsheet with All Data Collected and Analyzed
4. Instructional Answers to Significant Questions
5. Reflection

What follows is a breakdown of each of these deliverables.
# Student Profiles

During the ==previous formative assessment[^2]== analysis breakdown, you collected or created 10 student profiles. You will be using the same student profiles to continue your data collection and analysis. In a typical classroom situation, you would be implementing the assessments with the same group of students, so regardless of whether you had to invent the student profiles or were real and current students, you will be using the same profiles developed before.

Keep in mind that if you were asked to revise or refine the student profiles in the previous project, you will be applying those revisions here. Therefore, you will include them in your project again, whether they needed revision or not.

# Grading Rubric for Summative Assessment

Your rubric is the data collection tool for your assessment, and it is vitally important that it match the data you analyze. If you received full credit and no recommendations for revision when you submitted your Authentic Assessment Plan in Week 3, then you submit the same one to this project submission. [^1]

If your rubric needed revisions from Week 3, then you will need to submit the revised rubric here. Make sure it is in a separate file, so that if you originally submitted it together with your plan, simply copy paste it to a new file and save it to submit it here.

This rubric will be compared to the data you submit in your Excel spreadsheet. Remember that the levels of quality in your rubric need to match the column headings in your spreadsheet.

# Excel Spreadsheet with All Data Collected and Analyzed

## Summative Data Collected

Setting up data in spreadsheets needs to be oriented a certain way, or you will not be able to create the kind of analysis you need.

In your Wk 6 Interactive Review, Topic Four gave you a slide show of the step by step process for transferring data from a sample rubric onto a spreadsheet. You were even given the opportunity to download the Excel spreadsheet version of it.

_**The sample one provided in the interactive review was matched to a rubric I used, so do not just copy those headers.**_

In order to generate data to analyze, you will need to create it based on the ten student profiles. Your collected data from you rubrics will be on the same Excel file as your analysis, so make sure you create multiple spreadsheets in the same file, as shown in the sample Excel spreadsheet provided in the interactive review, and which you can also found lower in this page.

## Summative Assessment Data Analysis

In the interactive activities, you were given a process for putting collected data together in Excel and then the steps you take to analyze those data. I want to be able to see the process from collected to analyzed data. For example, think about the interactive slides where I went through the process. Each step had a sheet in a different state of analysis. Make sure you follow that process in a similar way, but _**make adjustments to match your own rubric criteria and levels of proficiency.**_

Therefore, you will submit 1 Excel spreadsheet, each with more than one sheet, so that each sheet in the document demonstrates the steps you are taking to analyze those data. Creating extra sheets in the same Excel document is very easy: simply click the circled "+" at the bottom.

Do not use the top row in the Excel spreadsheet to include a title. The top row is only for header labels. Put your title in the tab at the bottom or name your file specifically to the title you want. Spreadsheets are for clean data setups, and the don't work the same way as a Word document, which can include a title at the top. You will not be using Word to create your data analysis. If you do, you will be asked to redo it without grading.

Remember that the data collection and analysis for your summative assessment can all be organized in **_one Excel file_**. **Please follow the directions for how to do this carefully.**

# Instructional Answers to Significant Questions

When you do an analysis of data, you get groupings and patterns that tell you a story about your students. They have to lead to some form of answer to a significant question, or else the data gathering and analysis had no purpose. This is an important part of data literacy: knowing what it says and how to focus what you need from it. You can use a separate Word document for your questions and the instructional answers.

## Significant Question

For your summative assessment, you only ask one significant question.

You will write your significant question in the following manner: you can re-read your objective and change it into a question, in particular, focusing on student achievement of the objective.

Once you have determined your significant question, then the next step is to set up and analyze your data. You have one data set generated by your grading rubric. Review the instructions in the Interactive Review on how to analyze quantitative data.

## Instructional Answers

You will be answering your own significant questions, based on what your data told you upon analysis. Make a connection between the question you asked and the data results you have. Do not create answers that the data do not show. Intuition has no room here, although it is valuable in other ways.

Once you answer the question, then you explain what your next steps as a teacher are. In this case, you have to consider that you may no longer be able to re-teach or re-visit this particular objective, but there are some lessons you can learn as a teacher that may affect how you go about a future project with similar objectives. What did you learn about your students and their learning with this summative assessment that you have the potential for improving in a later unit?

Be as specific as possible and don't write generic answers like, "I need to ask students to use a clear process for solving problems." Instead, say, "Because students had a difficult time following a clear process for solving a problem, I will incorporate more modeling and use of steps for solving a problem that can be used in multiple tasks and for different curricular objectives."

# Reflection

All good teachers improve by first self-examining their practice and how it fits with your personal philosophy of learning and teaching. In this reflection, you will talk about your experience in analyzing summative, quantitative data. How was it different from past uses of data? How did it challenge your preconceptions of how to analyze data from assessments that use rubrics? How difficult was it for you to analyze data quantitatively from a rubric?

Write at least two well-developed paragraphs with a thorough reflection. Double spacing is appreciated, since it makes it easier to read. Thoroughness of reflection is evaluated, but not length. However, too short a reflection leaves your thoughts undeveloped, and too long a reflection overdoes it.

Please note that there are some guidelines of this reflection that are similar to the ones you wrote for previous projects. These are repeated, but within the context of this project, so consider your experience building this summative assessment data analysis to avoid repetition of ideas from previous reflections. Treat every event as if it were unique because it is.

# The Feedback You Will Receive

All project submissions will receive a grade, which isn't final until you decide it is. The grade is determined by the level of quality you demonstrate in the grading rubric. I recommend you review the rubric carefully so that you understand what the expectation of quality will be. Below is a link to the grading rubric, which you can also view in the assignment submission area.

[Summative Assessment Data Analysis Grading Rubric](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tKEla5XmD_Zbv_5o88p6GPjnIoC43KCG/view?usp=sharing "Summative Assessment Data Analysis Grading Rubric")

Therefore, when you first receive your grade, you should open the rubric to determine how the points were awarded to you. This will help you identify the areas of your project that will benefit from improvement.

However, the grade is not as important as the feedback you will receive. This is intended to help guide your learning so that you may improve your work. Therefore, if you decide that the quality of your project can be improved, read through the feedback carefully, and you will find guidance on how to improve it.

Because this is the last project, the final revision will take place during Week 7 in your final portfolio submission. You will not be able to submit revisions in the same submission area.
