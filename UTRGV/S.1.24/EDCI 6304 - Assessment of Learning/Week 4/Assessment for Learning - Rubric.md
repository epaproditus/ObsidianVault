| **4**          | The student can calculate the volume of the cylinder and also the hemisphere. The student understands that the question requires the calculation of a composite volume. | The student performs calculations accurately and efficiently, consistently checking and verifying their work with attention to detail.<br> | The student effectively selects and applies the relevant formulas.<br>                                                                                  |
| **3**          | The student can calculate the volume of the cylinder or the hemisphere but lacks understanding of composite volume.                                                     | The student performs calculations accurately with minimal errors and checks their work to ensure correctness.                              | The student understands how to substitute values into the volume formula but has difficulty calculating the volume of a sphere.                         |
| **2**          | The student shows partial understanding of the concepts. They may confuse the components or make errors in identifying them.                                            | The student makes some errors but attempts to correct them. They may not consistently check their work.                                    | The student attempts to use strategies but may choose inappropriate ones or apply them incorrectly. They show some effort in tackling complex problems. |
| **1**          | The student shows little to no understanding of the relationship between radius, height, and volume. They struggle to identify the correct components.                  | The student frequently makes errors in their calculations, leading to incorrect answers.                                                   | The student struggles to choose an appropriate strategy for solving the problems. They may not attempt to solve more complex problems.                  |
