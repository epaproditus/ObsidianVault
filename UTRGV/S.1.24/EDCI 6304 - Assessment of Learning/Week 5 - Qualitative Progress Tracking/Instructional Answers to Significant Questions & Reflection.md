### Questions
Q: In what ways does the learner demonstrate their understanding of the relationship between radius, height, and volume while explaining the process used by the volume formula to calculate the capacity of a cylinder on an Exit Ticket?

A: Based on the rubric, students exhibit a solid grasp of the concepts of volume and composite volume; however, they encounter difficulties when applying the appropriate formulas.



Q: How effectively does the learner calculate the volume of cylinders using the Volume formula based on the given dimensions in Module 5 Topic 4 Lesson 1, and what comments can be made regarding their understanding and application of this process?

A: Students are confident in identifying the parts of a cylinder but lack comfort in verifying the accuracy of their work.


To enhance students' understanding of volume calculation, I will design a practice activity where we explore the volume of various shapes, not only focusing on cylinders but also incorporating other polynomial bases. This activity can serve as a quick introduction at the beginning of class or an engaging wrap-up exercise.

### Reflection
I recently started using rubrics, although not in a formative assessment context. Utilizing rubrics for formative assessment along with checklists for self-assessment in this hypothetical scenario has revealed a concrete method I can implement in my classroom, especially as the school year progresses. My previous use of data has primarily focused on summative assessments. However, if I can gather qualitative data from students, I can effectively address misconceptions. Understanding the process has been quite challenging for me, as this assignment is over a week late, but the analysis holds significant potential benefits and is clearly worth the effort.
