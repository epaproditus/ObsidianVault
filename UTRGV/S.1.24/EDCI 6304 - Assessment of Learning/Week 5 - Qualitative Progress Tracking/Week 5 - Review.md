# In this Review

The purpose of this review is to introduce you to data literacy practices by working with qualitative data from formative assessments. During these activities, you will be revisiting the objective and the formative assessments you planned in the previous module. Your data analysis will be determined by what was assessed, why it was assessed, and what it says about your future planned instruction. Keep that in mind as you go through all the readings.

## Course Level Objective (CLO 5)

The in-service educator will determine how to use digital tools to record and analyze formative assessment data, making data-driven instructional decisions within the classroom assessment cycle.

## Module Level Objective (5.1)

In-service educators will review data collection and analysis of qualitative formative data gathered from digital tools in a SoftChalk Interactive Review.

## How This Review Works

Therefore, by the end of this review, you will have both read through all your assigned materials this week, as well as interact with questions.

Your readings will be completed as you go through this review. Each topic covers a different, but related area of this week's Qualitative Progress Tracking theme, each with a different set of readings. By the end of this review, you will have both read through all your assigned materials this week, as well as interact with questions related to those readings. Please make sure you save or bookmark external links or sources so that you can return to them for review. These readings are used not only in this activity, but in the rest of your Module 5 assignments.

You do not have to complete this review in one seating, but when you return to it, you must be in the same computer in order to pick up where you left off. Please make sure that your scores are being recorded as you continue. Your running total can be found at the top right hand of the review, under the main title.

Each embedded interactive activity indicates how many points it is worth. This interactive review is worth a total of 30 points. It can be redone an unlimited number of times.

In this first topic, you will review how types of data there are, and which kind you will be using.

Data generally are organized into two broad areas: qualitative and quantitative. The video below provides a very simple distinction between the two. Please keep in mind that even though the examples are not education related, the description of the two types of data still holds.

After watching the video, you will make note that your formative assessments for and as learning were both developed to gather <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">qualitative data</mark>, either observation notes, rubric, checklist, or rating scales. Whatever tool you used to gather formative data, for this discussion on data literacy, we will be looking at formative data as qualitative data. It isn't the only form it takes, but this is the most valuable form if you wish to truly understand what your students needs are, so that you can make informed decisions.

# Second Topic

## Setting Up Data for Analysis

In this second topic, you will review how to set up data for analysis. These include the following processes: 

- collecting and organizing data
- asking significant questions
- putting data in context.

Review the interactive slides below to understand each of them in the context of analysis.  _**Please note that you will be enacting these skills with your formative and summative assessment data, so spend extra time on them and make sure you understand how each of them is implemented.**_


### 1. Collecting and Organizing Data 
In teaching, data collection and organization are closely linked. You gather data in your classroom by implementing assessments designed for your students. Typically, this data consists of the grades students receive, which are quantitative since they are numerical. 

When it comes to formative assessments, you are collecting data that reflects a student's performance on a specific task rather than merely measuring their success in completing it. 

This is where the organization of data becomes essential. If you have made observation notes, it’s important to have a record-keeping tool to systematize your descriptions of each student. Similarly, if you have used checklists, you should compile the results from all checklists into a single record-keeping form. Excel is particularly effective for this purpose.

### 2. Asking Significant Questions
Sometimes, teachers forget a very important aspect of analyzing data: asking significant questions. In order for data to speak to you, you first need to ask it a question. However, there are ordinary questions, and then there are significant questions. Significant questions are only significant when they ask questions about your learning objectives and about student learning behaviors. 

They are not significant when they only ask about an end result. The most common question is: did students learn the concepts? But how helpful is that question to you as a teacher? If you learn students didn't learn the concept, you can reteach, but reteach what? This question is not useful if you can't identify what components of the content students didn't get, and with which parts of the thinking process they struggled.

### 3. Putting Data in Context
For teachers, putting data in context is critical. If you don't, you will not find out what you want to know, and your questions will not give you the answers you want. The context is your lesson. What were you teaching when you gathered your data? 

What were the learning objectives? If you were teaching geometric concepts, then the only context your data can be put is within the topics, activities, lesson materials you used. Therefore, if you put your data in this context, then your data will tell you what aspects of your topics, activities, or lesson materials really helped students learn the geometric concepts, and what you can change of that context.

## Analyzing and Transforming Data: Observations and Text Descriptions
Topics three and four are both on analysis and transformation of data. However, because there are two types of tools that were used (possibly more), each of them will be handled in its own topic. In this fourth topic, the focus will be on observations or other types of data that are gathered in text.

The data literacy areas that are relevant to analyzing and transforming data include the following:

- Knowing and understanding data properties
- Transforming data into information
- Transforming data into application

In order to analyze description, you need to set it up for analysis in a tool that allows you to manipulate it. When you manipulate description, what you are doing is reducing and re-organizing data in order to figure out a pattern of behavior from your students.

Consider an example from my own research, which focused on online professional development for content area experts. My significant question was as follows: what aspects of the online professional development were the most helpful to become better online teachers?

The interactive slides that follow provide you with the three steps for analyzing descriptive data. The embedded images of the spreadsheets can be zoomed by clicking on them.  _**Please note that descriptive or qualitative data will be submitted by everyone, regardless of grade or discipline, so understanding how to set it up is very important or your analysis will be faulty.**_

### Initial Data Setup
--- start-multi-column: ExampleRegion1  
```column-settings  
number of columns: 2  
largest column: left  
```

--- end-column ---

This image shows how to setup observation or text descriptions in Excel.  This example shows one observation event, but if you have several, you can create more than one column, one for each observed event. You can also put in text from journals, learning logs, interviews, or other text based descriptions. 

--- end-multi-column
![[SCR-20241117-svnl.png]]
After setting up data, this is the first step toward analysis.  In text descriptions, analysis involves finding patterns.  The sample you see is the same data in the previous slide, but this time, three additional columns were added to copy paste snippets from the notes that describe something related to your question.  In this case, I am looking for examples of feedback that is specific to the quality of the online learning experience, good or bad.  For more than one observation or text event, you use separate sheets to analyze them.


![[SCR-20241117-svrk.png]]In this second analysis step, you read through the snippets you gathered, and you look for a pattern.  This is a lot like sorting information into groups of like items.  In this example, I color code all the snippets that sound like they can be grouped together.  Once all snippets have a color, re-read all the ones of the same color and give that color a category name.  You do that for all the different colors you have.

## Analysis and Transformation of Data: Non-Numerical Checklists or Rubrics
In topic four, the focus will be on data gathered from non-numerical checklists or rubrics.

To review, the data literacy areas that are relevant to analyzing and transforming data include the following:

- Knowing and understanding data properties
- Transforming data into information
- Transforming data into application

If you used non-numerical checklists or rubrics, your record keeping tool was individual: one checklist or rubric per student. In order to setup your data for analysis, these data from all these checklists or rubrics need to be placed in one record keeping tool that includes all students assessed in this manner. This includes self-check or self-reflective checklists or rubrics that students filled out themselves.

This whole class record keeping tool will also be compiled in Excel. Here is an example of a checklist used with students.

[[Online Discussions Checklist Sample.pdf]]
![[SCR-20241117-sxft.png]]takes a little longer to put together simply because you are taking information from multiple checklists submitted by your students or completed by you and putting it all in one table.  You will notice some key features:  

1. The first column is always the list of names of the students
2. The number of columns that follow depends on the amount of criteria you put in your checklist or rubric.  The rubric I am using had
![[SCR-20241117-sxjo.png|250x250]]
4. This next step is repeated based on the amount of criteria you have in your checklist or rubric.  I have three, so I repeated it three times.

This is where you create a new sheet in the same Excel document (notice the tabs at the bottom that indicate four sheets in the document).  You transfer only the data from one of the criteria, and you repeat it with the others and you do a simple alphabetical sort.  This is just to put all like items together in an easy to see organization. The next two slides


![[SCR-20241117-sxvx.png]]
This third criteria sort indicates very quickly that this criteria was not met by several students, so this one becomes the focus of your next steps.  Not all data fall cleanly like this, but the sort helps you immediately see what the trends are.

## Stage 3: Plan and Implement Instruction
Now that you have reviewed setting up and analyzing data, let's take a moment to take a second look at stage 3 of the classroom assessment cycle, which was introduced during Week 4. Because formative assessments include teaching and adjusting, you will notice that analysis of formative data is a component of stage 3.![stage 3 planning and implementing instruciton](https://www.softchalkcloud.com/lesson/files/cRs9GM0SqwXBPO/assessment%20cycle%20stages%20stage%203%20wCC.png)
## Using Rubrics for Formative Assessment
This last topic this week is about the last chapters in the course book, [[Textbook.pdf]]. As part of this week's readings, you will read chapters 9-11 should have been reviewed. Although these readings do not have a clear and direct link to this week's activities, they do offer other ways to use rubrics for formative purposes. It also discussed using rubrics for grading. This will come in handy for the next stage in the classroom assessment cycle, which includes implementing a summative assessment and gathering student data from it.

In this week's readings and resources, you delved into two processes for analyzing qualitative data gathered from your formative assessments. This continued stage 3 of the classroom assessment cycle.

During this week, you will be completing your fourth assessment project, the Formative Assessment Data Analysis. 

**The information you reviewed in this interactive activity should also be downloaded and used as the steps you will take when you analyze your data.**  This is an area where most teachers have no experience, so don't deviate from this process.  Formative assessment data does not include grades.  Let me repeat:  _**it does not include grades.**_
