## Topic 1: Stage 2: Planning Summative Assessments
Stage 2 of the classroom assessment cycle is to <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">plan the summative assessment</mark>. This is an important part of backwards design. If you know what students will be evaluated on at the end of the unit, you can plan the lesson and formative assessments to meet that end when students get there.

This is why in this stage, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">you only develop the assessment</mark>. You don't implement it yet. However, this is the assessment that will determine all other decisions in this assessment cycle. Remember that you have already started the process with your objectives. At this point, you will have an opportunity to refine your assessment of learning objective before you design the summative assessment. However, that will be something you will build towards as you work through these activities.

For the moment, take a look at the close up of stage 2 in the cycle and the guiding questions you will ask yourself to determine what your summative assessment will be.

_**Will it allow students to demonstrate achievement of the learning objective?**_

Stage one was to set the objective. Stage two is to develop a plan to assess that objective. Therefore, when planning the summative assessment, what needs to be specifically evident is that the assessment asks students to demonstrate knowledge of it.

_**Does it assess the thinking level indicated in the objective?**_

The thinking level is determined by cross-referencing the verb in the objective with Bloom's Taxonomy of cognitive levels. In stage 2, it is about ensuring that the summative assessment allows students to actually demonstrate that level of thinking in order to match what the objective has indicated.

_**Will the degree of mastery be qualitatively or quantitatively demonstrated?**_

The degree of mastery in a summative assessment is associated with a demonstration of proficiency or success. In most summative assessments, the first measure of success is the minimum passing grade that a student receives to be considered successful. This is usually a quantitative measure because it is often numerical. However, it is not enough. Another way that degree of mastery is demonstrated in a summative assessment is by making a list of criteria or skills that students must master to indicate they are successful. These often are qualitative in nature because they point to descriptors of success in words, not numbers.

## Topic 2: Alignment and Rigor
Two important criteria for well-designed assessments are alignment and rigor. It is important to verify that your objectives and assessments are properly aligned and that your assessments show the level of rigor that your objective indicates. Before you can move to more details about summative assessments, it is important that you know how to check for alignment and rigor.

Because these two concepts are examined in the context of Bloom's Taxonomy and thinking levels, here is the image as a reference point. [[Blooms Taxonomy Revisited.pdf]]

---
*The cognitive complexity of a skill within a standard or an assessment is best described by:*

**b. rigor**

Rigor refers to the depth of knowledge and the level of cognitive demand required to understand, analyze, and apply information or skills. It encapsulates the complexity involved in mastering a particular skill or concept.

---
*Alignment ensures that the assessment measures what you want students to know and be able to do.*

---
The correct answers for unpacking a standard are:

- a. identify all the skills
- b. the content to be studied
- c. the specific task
- d. the formative assessment

All options are part of unpacking a standard.

## Topic 3: Assessment of Learning
Summative assessments are assessments of learning, which usually occur at the end of a unit or lesson. In chapter 5 of "Rethinking Classroom Assessments with Purpose in Mind", you will learn a little more about the purpose and process of summative assessments, the audiences that benefit from reporting out results from them, and the teacher's role in the experience.

## Topic 4: Types of Authentic Assessments
In the last two topics, you reviewed the purposes and conditions that need to exist in a summative assessment. In this third topic, you will begin thinking of your summative assessment, or your assessment of learning, as an authentic representation of learning. This may mean that your objective and assessment description originally submitted in the Balanced Assessment may take a drastic change.

As classroom teachers, many of you are well versed in benchmarks, standardized tests, and multiple-choice tests. This class is not about any of those, but about assessing for authentic learning purposes, not just to pass a test.

The next readings describe three different types of authentic assessments: performance-based assessments, project-based assessments, and problem-based assessments. While they do share some characteristics, and depending on the source, they have all been called PBL. There are some essential differences that make them distinct, however. Read the articles in the table below, then respond to the activities that follow.

### Three Types of Authentic Assessments

| Performance Based                                                                                                                                                                                        | Project Based                                                                                                                                                                            | Problem Based                                                                                                                                                 |

#### Performance Based
**A performance task is an assessment method that requires students to apply their knowledge and skills in real-world contexts through open-ended projects, promoting critical thinking and collaboration.**

A performance task is a type of assessment that requires students to demonstrate their knowledge and skills through tangible products or performances. Unlike traditional assessments like multiple-choice questions, performance tasks are open-ended and allow for multiple correct responses, fostering deeper understanding and real-world application. Characteristics include the necessity for applying knowledge in authentic contexts, transferring learning to new situations, multi-faceted tasks integrating different subjects and skills, and evaluations based on established criteria and rubrics. Examples include projects like redesigning a public space, evaluating product claims, and conducting accident investigations. These tasks enhance engagement and encourage critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration among students. https://blog.performancetask.com/what-is-a-performance-task-part-1-9fa0d99ead3b

#### Project Based
https://www.pblworks.org/what-is-pbl
Project Based Learning (PBL) is distinct from simply “doing a project.” PBL is an educational approach where the project itself serves as the primary means for teaching essential knowledge and skills, contrasting with "dessert projects," which are lighter and follow traditional instruction. PBL emphasizes critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, and communication, requiring students to employ higher-order thinking skills and teamwork.

To ensure effective PBL implementation, PBLWorks offers the Gold Standard PBL model, which includes seven essential project design elements and seven project-based teaching practices. These guidelines support educators in creating high-quality projects and enhancing their teaching methodologies. The Gold Standard model aligns with the High Quality PBL Framework, which articulates key student expectations during projects.

#### Problem Based
https://citl.illinois.edu/citl-101/teaching-learning/resources/teaching-strategies/problem-based-learning-(pbl)
PBL is a teaching approach that uses complex real-world problems to enhance student learning of concepts and principles, rather than simply presenting facts. This method fosters critical thinking, problem-solving, communication skills, and group collaboration while promoting lifelong learning.

Key Characteristics of Good PBL Problems:

- Motivates deeper understanding of concepts.
- Requires reasoned decision-making and justification.
- Connects to prior knowledge and course objectives.
- Has sufficient complexity for group collaboration.
- Initiates with open-ended, engaging starting points.

PBL can be adapted across various subjects and settings, and it's beneficial to introduce problems in stages to help students identify learning issues. Teachers are encouraged to create structured guides for implementing PBL in their courses, including defining learning objectives and identifying resources.

The distribution methods for PBL problems include case studies, role-plays, and simulations, all centered around real-world issues, ensuring an interactive and practical learning experience.

## Topic 6: Using Rubrics in a Summative Assessment
Chapters 3 - 6 [[Textbook.pdf]]
**Summary of Chapters 3-6 of "How to Create and Use Rubrics for Formative Assessment and Grading" by Susan M. Brookhart**

* *Chapters 3 to 6 of Brookhart's work focus on the development and application of effective rubrics in education, highlighting the importance of clear criteria and performance descriptions. 
* _Chapter 3 emphasizes the foundational elements of creating rubrics, such as appropriate criteria and descriptive performance levels, advocating for collaborative efforts in their development. 
* _Chapter 4 discusses general rubrics that assess fundamental skills like writing and mathematics, while Chapter 5 covers task-specific rubrics designed for grading straightforward tasks that assess recall and comprehension. 
* _Finally, Chapter 6 introduces proficiency-based rubrics aligned with standards-based grading, promoting tracking of student progress and clear achievement levels. 
* _Collectively, these chapters illustrate the critical role of well-constructed rubrics in enhancing teaching effectiveness and supporting student learning.*


**Chapter 3: Writing or Selecting Effective Rubrics**  
_This chapter outlines the essentials for creating effective rubrics, emphasizing clear criteria and performance descriptions while promoting collaborative development and revision.

This chapter focuses on the fundamentals of writing or selecting effective rubrics. Brookhart emphasizes two crucial components of a quality rubric: appropriate criteria and clear performance descriptions. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">The first task in rubric development is to determine the criteria that define good work related to the learning outcomes the rubric aims to measure, instead of merely outlining the task itself</mark>. Effective criteria must be appropriate, definable, observable, and distinct. The chapter also discusses how to write <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">performance-level descriptions that avoid evaluative language</mark>, instead depicting actual observed performance. These descriptions should cover a continuum of quality from low to high and maintain clarity and consistency across all performance levels.

Brookhart suggests two approaches for creating rubrics: the top-down approach, which starts with a general framework of expected performance, and the bottom-up approach, which begins with existing student work samples and generates the rubric from there. The chapter stresses the importance of revision and collaborative construction of rubrics to enhance their effectiveness.

**Chapter 4: General Rubrics for Fundamental Skills**  
*This chapter discusses the use of general rubrics for assessing fundamental skills like writing and mathematics problem solving, emphasizing clarity and consistency in criteria.*

In this chapter, Brookhart discusses the importance of general rubrics for assessing foundational skills such as writing and mathematics. She highlights the widely recognized 6+1 Trait Writing rubrics, which have become essential tools for evaluating student writing. These rubrics clarify the essential qualities of writing and support teaching and learning processes. The chapter also touches on mathematics problem-solving rubrics that have evolved to include concepts of strategic and mathematical communication.

General rubrics are characterized by their ability to apply across multiple assignments and their focus on critical aspects of learning rather than individual tasks. They guide students towards an understanding of quality work, enabling them to improve over time through repeated application of these rubrics.

**Chapter 5: Task-Specific Rubrics and Scoring Schemes for Special Purposes** 
_This chapter explains the appropriate use of task-specific rubrics for grading tasks that assess recall and comprehension, highlighting simple grading structures for effective evaluation._
This chapter explains task-specific rubrics, which are useful primarily for grading work that assesses students' recall and comprehension. While general rubrics are favorable for formative and ongoing assessments, task-specific rubrics can more efficiently evaluate performances that have a right or wrong answer. Brookhart illustrates this by providing examples from mathematics and science assessments that require clear, precise answers and explanations.

Task-specific rubrics facilitate quick grading, especially for multipoint test questions, as they focus on straightforward correctness rather than evaluating learning through a broader lens. The chapter also notes that while task-specific rubrics can serve a purpose, they lack the depth of general rubrics and should be used strategically in situations where they add value.

**Chapter 6: Proficiency-Based Rubrics for Standards-Based Grading** 
*This chapter outlines the creation and use of proficiency-based rubrics that align assessments with standards-based grading systems to track and report student progress accurately.*
Brookhart discusses proficiency-based rubrics, which are aligned with standards-based grading systems, ensuring consistent interpretation of student performance across different assessments. These rubrics help track student progress concerning specific standards rather than merely assigning numerical scores or percentages. The chapter outlines how to create proficiency-based rubrics through three steps: establishing a general framework of performance levels, developing general rubrics for each standard, and specifying performance requirements for individual assessments.

The purpose of proficiency-based rubrics is to provide a clear guide for both students and teachers regarding levels of achievement. They facilitate ongoing learning by allowing students to set goals, track their progress, and engage in self-assessment. By summarizing multiple assessments' results, proficiency-based rubrics enhance the clarity and relevance of report card grades.

Overall, Chapters 3-6 emphasize the importance of well-constructed rubrics and their significant role in supporting effective teaching and facilitating student learning through clear criteria and performance expectations. These chapters advocate for the use of rubrics as a way to bridge the gap between assessment and meaningful feedback that fosters both understanding and improvement in student work.

## Conclusion


#### Addendum
**Chapter 5 Summary: Task-Specific Rubrics and Scoring Schemes for Special Purposes**

Chapter 5 discusses the use of task-specific rubrics, highlighting their particular advantages in grading and assessment contexts where the goal is to assess students' recall and understanding of factual and conceptual knowledge. The author notes that while general rubrics are often preferred for their flexibility and formative assessment capabilities, task-specific rubrics serve essential roles in particular scenarios.

**Key Points:![]()**
1. **Purpose of Task-Specific Rubrics**: 
   - Primarily used for evaluating specific tasks that require factual recall, comprehension, or the singular application of knowledge.
   - Ideal for grading performance on standardized tests or assignments where multiple-choice or short-answer questions are used.

2. **Construction of Task-Specific Rubrics**:
   - Rubrics should be designed concurrently with the assessment task, incorporating criteria directly related to the expected outcomes of that task.
   - Descriptions of performance levels should <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">reflect varying degrees of correctness</mark>, rather than just overall performance quality.

3. **Examples of Task-Specific Rubrics**:
   - Provides illustrations for mathematics problems, science essays, and other areas where precise knowledge recall and demonstration are paramount.
   - Demonstrates how to structure rubrics with clear scoring levels that communicate expectations effectively to students, allowing them to understand how their work is assessed.

4. **Use in Grading**:
   - Emphasizes that these rubrics are particularly beneficial for grading tests where students do not receive feedback for revision.
   - Suggests using holistic analyses within these rubrics for scoring, as this may simplify the grading process without sacrificing the integrity of the assessment.

5. **Limitations and Recommendations**:
   - Even while task-specific rubrics can streamline grading, they are limited in scope compared to general rubrics.
   - They should be used selectively, particularly when assessments are focused on clear recall or procedural engagement rather than deeper cognitive skills.

**Quotes from Chapter 5**:
1. "Task-specific rubrics are useful for grading student work intended to assess recall and comprehension of a body of knowledge—remembering and understanding facts and concepts."
   
2. "For me and for others who work with teachers and rubrics...the advantages that come with using rubrics to support student learning are so significant."

3. "When you are grading test questions for a final exam...task-specific rubrics make for quick, reliable grading."

4. "Writing task-specific rubrics for multipoint test questions differs from writing general rubrics...you can use teacher language."

5. "It’s very important to know what specific set of information you will need for your report card grade before you record your individual grades."

Through this chapter, Brookhart emphasizes the strategic application of task-specific rubrics, underscoring that they can enhance clarity in assessment practices when deployed correctly and in the right contexts.
