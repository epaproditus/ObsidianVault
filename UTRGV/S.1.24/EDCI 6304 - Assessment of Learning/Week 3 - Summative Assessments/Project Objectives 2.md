| Assessment as Learning  | The learner will explain the process that the volume formula uses to calculate the capacity of a cylinder by describing the relationship between radius, height, and volume on an Exit Ticket | This is a formative assessment that supports student thinking to demonstrate their understanding of how the formula describes volume (as the volume of several disks on top of one another to create a cylinder) | The assessment is for self-assessment. Students should understand that the volume formula calculates the volume of a disk and then stacks many disks on top of one another to create volume thus the height of a cylinder can be consider the number of disks are stacked inside of the curved 3-D shape. |

### Reflection
- How was it different from the assessments you usually use?
	- The requirement for the Assessment of Learning to focus on an "authentic task" is unfamiliar to me. I typically rely on traditional assessment methods, such as end-of-topic evaluations. 
	- While I often consider how students will ultimately demonstrate proficiency in an Assessment of Learning, I do not formally integrate this into my planning. My usual thought process is, "How will this be assessed on the STAAR test?" Moreover, it is not a primary consideration in my current planning process, as the existing curriculum largely dictates lesson objectives, and any deviation is discouraged.

- How did it challenge your preconceptions of what an assessment should be?
	- I am genuinely intrigued by the concept of "authentic tasks" and how we might integrate them into the assessment of learning. I frequently conducTo help you reflect on the questions related to [[Project Objectives]], let's break down each reflection question and explore some guiding questions that can lead you to your original thoughts. 

- How difficult was it for you to create this balanced plan and why?
	- I found the balanced plan relatively easy to create. Utilizing Carnegie Learning, which offers substantial support for educators, coupled with two years of third-party assistance, has made me accustomed to this planning approach, even if I haven't formalized it to the extent described here.
