**user**: Do you see [[Wk3 Project 2]]?
[Timestamp: 2024/11/28 20:50:26]

**ai**: Yes, I see [[Wk3 Project 2]].  It outlines the requirements for creating an Authentic Summative Assessment Plan, the second of five projects culminating in a final Week 7 project and portfolio artifact.

Here's a breakdown of the key components of [[Wk3 Project 2]]:

**1. Revisit and Revise Objective:**

* Review the learning objective from the Balanced Assessment Plan ([[Project Objectives]]).
* Ensure it answers "yes" to three key questions (relevance, measurability, and achievability).
* Verify alignment with chosen standards and appropriate rigor.  Consider Bloom's Taxonomy, aiming for higher-order thinking.
* Revise the objective or choose a new standard if necessary.  Adjust formative assessment objectives accordingly.

**2. Create the PBL:**

* Choose one of three PBL types: Project-Based, Problem-Based Scenario, or Performance-Based Project.
* Ensure the PBL is real-world connected, meaningful to students, and requires higher-order thinking.
* Provide a detailed description handout for students, including necessary materials, tools, templates, and links/screenshots of digital resources.
* Consider using Generative AI (like Microsoft Copilot) for planning, but ensure the final submission is your own work (80% or more). Include AI conversation transcripts in an appendix if used.

**3. Develop the Rubric:**

* Create a task-specific or proficiency-based rubric (analytic or holistic). Avoid general rubrics.
* Ensure the rubric evaluates achievement of the learning objective.
* Use 3-5 criteria that describe vital elements contributing to demonstrated learning.
* Use descriptive quality descriptors for at least three proficiency levels (avoid numerical points).
* Consider embedding grammar/writing skills within relevant criteria rather than as a standalone criterion.

**4. Write a Reflection:**

* Reflect on the process of designing the authentic summative assessment.
* Consider how it differs from traditional assessments, challenges preconceptions, and the difficulty level of creating a suitable PBL.
* Write at least two well-developed paragraphs.

**5. Submission and Feedback:**

* Submit all components: student handout, materials, rubric, and reflection.
* Review the provided grading rubric ([Authentic Summative Assessment Grading Rubric](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uMYclmCTvsFhEF4tGz8zzqRtz5y24vGZ/view?usp=sharing "Authentic Summative Assessment Grading Rubric")) to understand expectations.
* Revise and resubmit based on feedback before starting the next project.


I can help you with any of these steps.  For example, if you tell me your learning objective and chosen standard, I can help you check for alignment and rigor.  Or, if you describe your subject and grade level, I can brainstorm PBL ideas with you. Just let me know what you need!

**user**: make your answers short and concise. I need you to narrow down on the rubric only. do you see it? just acknowledge. 
[Timestamp: 2024/11/28 20:51:46]

**ai**: Yes, I see the rubric requirements.

[Timestamp: 2024/11/28 20:51:47]

**user**: I have a list of 10 students here [[Student Profiles]]. Do you see it. just acknowledge. 
[Timestamp: 2024/11/28 20:52:04]

**ai**: Yes, I see [[Student Profiles]].

[Timestamp: 2024/11/28 20:52:05]

**user**: I want to use the [[Student Profiles]] to fill out a rubric. Let's use Yasmin as an example
[Timestamp: 2024/11/28 20:53:42]

**ai**: You haven't provided a rubric.  The student profiles give information *about* the students, but not how that information would translate into rubric *scores*.  To help with that, you need to share the rubric itself.  What are the criteria and proficiency levels being assessed?

[Timestamp: 2024/11/28 20:53:44]

**user**: The rubric is on [[Wk 3 Project 2 - Project-based Assessment]]
[Timestamp: 2024/11/28 20:54:20]

**ai**: Okay, I see the rubric now.  Here's how Yasmin's profile might translate to rubric scores, keeping in mind this is an *interpretation* and teacher judgment is key:

* **Accuracy of Calculations:** Likely **Excellent (4)**. Her profile states she has a solid understanding of math and strives for accuracy.  She also seeks teacher verification, suggesting attention to detail.
* **Application of Formulas:** Likely **Excellent (4)**.  Her solid math understanding and accuracy-seeking nature suggest she can apply formulas correctly.
* **Understanding of Concepts:** Likely **Excellent (4)**.  Her profile highlights her diligence with challenging problems, implying a deeper understanding beyond basic application.
* **Use of Runoff Coefficient:** Likely **Excellent (4)**.  While not explicitly mentioned, her overall strong performance and diligence suggest she would likely grasp and apply this concept effectively.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Language Proficiency:** While Yasmin is LEP, her strong English proficiency and lack of learning difficulties suggest language won't significantly hinder her performance on this project.  However, be mindful of providing support if needed, especially with complex terminology.
* **Habits of Mind:**  Her persistence and openness to learning are strengths that will support her project completion.

This is a starting point.  Observing Yasmin's actual work on the project will allow for a more accurate assessment.
