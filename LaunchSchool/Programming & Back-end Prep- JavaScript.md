Welcome to the **Programming and Back-end Prep Course: JavaScript** for the program at Launch School. The goal of this prep course is to give you some structure and guidance before starting our real program. You must complete all assignments listed in this course before registering. Otherwise, you may not be able to keep up with the coursework.

#### How carefully should I go through this Prep course?

1. If you're pretty new to programming (less than 6 months of self-directed study), you should take your time through this prep course. It's very important that you understand basic JavaScript and programming concepts. We strongly recommend that you not only complete everything in this course but also supplement the assignments with the JavaScript track at Codecademy.
    
2. Take your time with the [Introduction to Programming with JavaScript](https://launchschool.com/books/javascript) book. While you may be able to finish most other assignments in this course quickly, the book is crucial and should be studied well. Even if you're an experienced programmer, you should not skip it. You still need to develop muscle memory in your fingers to write JavaScript code quickly. The practice problems in the book are an excellent way to do that.
    
3. If you're an experienced JavaScript programmer, you may be tempted to skip the Prep course entirely. Don't. JavaScript has many subtleties that experienced programmers often don't understand as well as they think.
    

Your goal in our program should not be to "get through it," but to learn the knowledge in it. Getting quickly through it won't help you, but if you can retain and apply the knowledge in the program, you will be able to pass the assessments.

#### How is this different from the real course?

The interface here is very similar to the real course. However, in this prep course, there are no discussions and no TAs or instructors. We want you to power through these materials by yourself. Take your time, especially if you've never programmed seriously before (meaning, you've never really sat down and worked through a program for 2 to 4 hours).

Learn the basics of JavaScript syntax and become as fluent with it as possible. Learn to develop a programmer's mentality by working through the practice problems. And learn how to push your code to GitHub periodically. All these skills are mandatory before you start the program.

#### Why do I need to learn JavaScript before starting the first JavaScript course?

The pre-course work here is meant to prepare you for the upcoming courses. If you're an existing programmer, some of this may seem basic to you - you can skim, skip or work through it. If you are a [Deferred Payment Program](https://launchschool.com/deferred) (DPP) applicant, you will be required to take a technical assessment and participate in a DPP Applicant Interview following the completion of the preparatory course.

If you're new to programming, it's absolutely critical that you take your time to do all the practice problems here. Learning to program in the early stages is a two-step process:

1. Learn programming constructs and grammar and syntax.
2. Learn to build a functioning application with knowledge from above; the "putting it together" stage.

Programmers get paid to do #2, and even if you want to build your own projects, your end goal is to build an application. The problem beginners encounter is that doing task #2 requires architectural and logical reasoning. For example, a logical requirement of your application could be "If my cards are greater than 21, then I've busted. Otherwise, I want to hit or stay again." However, if your programming language knowledge is weak, you won't know how to type out the "if" condition in programming syntax very quickly. Your fingers won't be able to type it, your train of thought will be interrupted as you search for the right syntax. Moving back and forth between #1 and #2 is a very frustrating experience.

Our courses are focused on #2 - we're like a writer's camp that teaches you how to write an essay or novel. However, to teach higher-level concepts, we need to assume that you know basic grammar and syntax. You must have those skills when you start. Take your time to practice and type out all the practice problems. Train your fingers to type JavaScript code quickly. It's not enough to just say "I understand" - you need to force yourself to go through the act of typing out code, over and over and over.

#### How well do I really need to know this?

Do every assignment listed in this course, and you should be ready. Everyone has different backgrounds and abilities, so it's hard to say that it's going to be smooth sailing for everyone.

Work through the materials and books in the assignments, and take as much time as you need to. If you're very new to programming, the more practice you have with a programming language, the better. It's vital to set strong foundations early. There's no use in learning higher-level frameworks or libraries if you don't have strong basic programming knowledge. The time invested in learning the basics now will pay off a hundred times over in the future.

What we've seen over and over are junior developers or bootcamp graduates wishing they'd taken more time to learn the basics. No one has ever thought, "I wish I didn't learn Ruby/JavaScript so well early in my career." You won't either. Spend the time now, and you'll be able to digest more advanced material faster and with more clarity. Our courses get very difficult and, as you move through them, the conversations will be at a higher-level, stretching your comfort level and challenging your understanding. You'll be glad that you spent the extra effort when you can understand and participate in those conversations. Conversely, if you cannot understand and participate in those conversations, then, likely, you did not spend the extra effort on the basics.

==It's also worth bearing in mind, especially if you're completely new to programming, that the learning curve at the start can be quite steep, and even overwhelming at times. This is completely natural,== and you may need to go over a particular concept several times for things to make sense or really click. If you get completely stuck, you should always feel free to reach out for help. We have a very engaged and supportive community here at Launch School. Reach out in Slack, particularly the [#prep-course-questions channel](https://launchschool.slack.com/archives/C4ABCN8UA), or the [General Forum](https://launchschool.com/forum). We also have regular Beginner Study Sessions where you can ask questions about fundamental concepts, share study tips, and meet other students; be sure to keep an eye out for upcoming sessions in the [Study Groups tab of the Forum](https://launchschool.com/forum?tab=Study+Groups) and on the [Events page](https://launchschool.com/events).
